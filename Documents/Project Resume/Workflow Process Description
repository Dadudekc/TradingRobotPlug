## Workflow Process Description for Interview

**Overview:**
My workflow process involves a systematic approach to handling data preprocessing, model training, and code organization. I ensure each step is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and optimized for performance.

**1. Problem Identification and Planning:**
   - **Objective:** Preprocess financial data, train an LSTM model, and ensure the codebase was modularized for better maintainability and readability.
   - **Planning:** Outlined the key tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and modularizing the code into distinct files.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Initial Data Inspection:**
     - Loaded the dataset and inspected the initial shape (3536, 46) and identified NaN values in various columns.
     - Handled NaN values by investigating their presence and deciding on appropriate measures (e.g., filling with median values).
   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Dropped non-numeric columns to ensure all data used was suitable for numerical computations.
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Created lag and rolling window features to capture temporal patterns in the financial data.
     - Ensured all data was numeric and filled remaining NaN values with median values to prevent data loss during processing.
     - Final dataset was ready for model training with the transformed shape of (3536, 58).

**3. Model Training:**
   - **Model Selection:**
     - Chose the LSTM model for its suitability in handling time-series data.
   - **Training Process:**
     - Split the data into training and validation sets.
     - Configured the LSTM model with appropriate layers and hyperparameters.
     - Trained the model for 50 epochs, monitoring the training process and logging intermediate results.
   - **Evaluation:**
     - Calculated final validation metrics: MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
     - Ensured the model's performance met the required benchmarks.
   - **Model Saving:**
     - Saved the trained model to a specified path for future use and deployment.

**4. Code Modularization:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance code readability and maintainability by breaking down the monolithic script into modular components.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Separated data preprocessing tasks into `data_preprocessing.py`.
     - Moved model training functions to `model_training.py`.
     - Created `main.py` to orchestrate the overall process, ensuring each module was correctly integrated.
   - **Documentation and Testing:**
     - Documented each module with clear explanations and usage examples.
     - Thoroughly tested each component to ensure functionality and correctness.

**5. Error Handling and Logging:**
   - **Logging:**
     - Implemented logging to track the process and facilitate debugging.
     - Logged key events, such as data loading, preprocessing steps, model training progress, and final results.
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Added robust error handling to catch and log exceptions, ensuring smooth execution and easier debugging.

**6. Continuous Improvement:**
   - **Feedback and Iteration:**
     - Continuously monitored the process for potential improvements.
     - Iterated on feedback, refining data preprocessing steps, model configurations, and overall workflow.
   - **Collaboration Tools:**
     - Utilized ChatGPT for assistance in solving problems, improving code structure, and ensuring best practices.

By demonstrating this structured and methodical approach to data science tasks, I ensure clarity, efficiency, and maintainability at each step of the project.
