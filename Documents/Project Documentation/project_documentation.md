## Project Overview
The Trading Robot Plug is a Python-based application designed to fetch and process financial data from multiple sources, primarily Alpha Vantage and Polygon, and provide users with a comprehensive interface to interact with this data. The application features a GUI developed with Tkinter, supports asynchronous data fetching, and implements robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## Objectives
- **Data Fetching:** Ensure the system properly handles date inputs and defaults to fetching one year of data.
- **File Naming:** Improve file naming conventions for saved data files.
- **User Feedback:** Implement user feedback in the GUI to inform users about the status of their data fetching requests.
- **Fallback Handling:** Handle cases where Alpha Vantage is the primary data source and Polygon is used as a fallback.

## System Architecture
### High-Level Overview
The system is composed of several key components:
- **Data Fetchers:** Modules responsible for fetching data from different APIs.
- **GUI:** A user interface that allows users to interact with the system and initiate data fetch requests.
- **Utilities:** Helper functions and modules for configuration handling, logging, and data storage.
- **Tests:** Unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system.

## Modules and Components
### Data Fetchers
- **Alpha Vantage Fetcher:** Handles data fetching from Alpha Vantage API.
- **Polygon Fetcher:** Handles data fetching from Polygon API.
- **Base Fetcher:** A base class for common fetching functionalities.
- **Real-Time Fetcher:** Fetches real-time data.

### GUI
- **Base GUI:** The base class for the GUI components.
- **Data Fetch Tab:** Handles the tab for data fetching within the GUI.
- **Fetcher GUI:** The main GUI application.

### Utilities
- **Config Handling:** Manages configuration settings.
- **Data Fetch Utils:** Utility functions for data fetching.
- **Data Store:** Manages data storage operations.
- **DataLakeHandler:** Handles interactions with a data lake.

## Data Handling
Data is fetched from Alpha Vantage and Polygon APIs, processed, and stored in a structured manner. File naming conventions include the symbol, data source, and date range for easy identification and retrieval.

### Example File Naming
- `AAPL_alpha_vantage_data_2023-07-15_to_2024-07-14.csv`
- `GOOG_polygon_data_2023-07-15_to_2024-07-14.csv`

## User Interface
The GUI is developed using Tkinter and provides the following functionalities:
- Date input fields with default values set to one year from the current date.
- Clear default date logic when the user starts typing in the date fields.
- "Fetch All Data" button to fetch all available data.
- Real-time feedback about the fetching status and saved file names.

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage is implemented to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system. Unit tests are organized in the `Tests` directory and cover various modules and functionalities.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Navigate to the Tests directory
cd C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Tests

# Run the tests
python -m unittest discover
```

## Challenges and Solutions
### Circular Imports
Circular imports caused initial import errors. This was resolved by restructuring the imports and dependencies properly.

### Date Handling in GUI
Ensuring the date handling logic in the GUI correctly sets and clears default dates improved the user experience.

### User Feedback
Implementing real-time feedback in the GUI about the status of data fetching requests enhanced transparency and usability.

### Fallback Logic
Properly handling the fallback logic between Alpha Vantage and Polygon APIs ensured seamless data fetching even when one source was unavailable.

## Future Work
- Continue refining and testing the data fetching components.
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all modules.
- Implement additional features and enhancements based on user feedback.
- Update project documentation with recent changes and commit to the repository.

## Appendix
- **Configuration File:** `config.ini`
- **Environment Variables:** `.env`
- **Metadata Files:** `metadata_alpha_vantage.csv`, `metadata_polygon.csv`
