**Overview:**
My workflow process involves a systematic approach to handling data preprocessing, model training, and code organization. I ensure each step is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and optimized for performance.

**1. Problem Identification and Planning:**
   - **Objective:** Preprocess financial data, train an LSTM model, and ensure the codebase was modularized for better maintainability and readability.
   - **Planning:** Outlined the key tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and modularizing the code into distinct files.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Initial Data Inspection:**
     - Loaded the dataset and inspected the initial shape (3536, 46) and identified NaN values in various columns.
     - Handled NaN values by investigating their presence and deciding on appropriate measures (e.g., filling with median values).
   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Dropped non-numeric columns to ensure all data used was suitable for numerical computations.
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Created lag and rolling window features to capture temporal patterns in the financial data.
     - Ensured all data was numeric and filled remaining NaN values with median values to prevent data loss during processing.
     - Final dataset was ready for model training with the transformed shape of (3536, 58).

**3. Model Training:**
