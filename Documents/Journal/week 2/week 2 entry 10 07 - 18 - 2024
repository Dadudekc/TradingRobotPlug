     - **Opportunity Cost Assessment**: Included potential earnings sacrificed from working multiple jobs and attending college.
     - **Direct Development Costs**: Accounted for actual out-of-pocket expenses for software, hardware, and other development needs.
     - **User Growth Projections**: Revised user growth projections to reflect realistic early-stage growth.
     - **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**: Calculated future cash flows with a higher discount rate to account for higher risk.
   - **Final Valuation**: Concluded with a conservative valuation of approximately $114,140, balancing personal investment and realistic future potential.

**2. Issue Resolution and Debugging:**
   - **Run Training Script:** Executed the script located at `c:/TheTradingRobotPlug/Scripts/ModelTraining/Model_training_tab_main.py`.

   - Verified the addition of the project root to the Python path by printing the paths.

**14. Checking Module Existence:**
   - Introduced debug prints to confirm the exact paths being added and to check if the `Data_processing_utils.py` file exists at the specified location.

**15. Updating Test Script:**
   - Updated the test script with additional debug prints and path validity checks.

**16. Refactoring Code to Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Refactored a script to use object-oriented programming principles by encapsulating functions and attributes within a class named `AutomatedModelTrainer`.
   - Grouped related functionalities into methods of the class to enhance readability and maintainability.
   - Improved error handling and logging within each method.
   - Managed training progress and scheduling directly within the class to streamline automated tasks.

**17. Key Changes Implemented:**
