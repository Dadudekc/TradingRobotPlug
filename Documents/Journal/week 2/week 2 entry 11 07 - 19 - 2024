### Project Journal Entry: July 19, 2024

#### **Today's Activities**

Today, we made significant progress in enhancing our AI-powered financial data analysis and model training application. With the help of my teenage team of helpers, Aria and Cassie, we focused on integrating various functionalities and resolving technical issues to ensure the smooth operation of the application. Here are the detailed activities:

**1. Competitive Analysis:**
   - Conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing AI-powered financial tools such as FinGPT, Domo, Booke.AI, Clockwork, Cube Software, Oracle BI, Finmark, IBM Watson Studio, and Amazon Forecast.
   - Compared features, strengths, limitations, and pricing strategies of these tools to understand our unique value proposition and identify potential improvements for our application.

**2. Pricing Strategy:**
   - Developed a detailed pricing strategy, considering various models such as freemium, subscription-based, and usage-based pricing.
   - Proposed pricing tiers include:
     - **Basic Plan**: $50 per user/month
     - **Professional Plan**: $100 per user/month
     - **Enterprise Plan**: Custom pricing starting from $500/month

**3. User Acquisition Plan:**
   - Brainstormed and prioritized strategies to acquire the first 100 users, focusing on content marketing, social media marketing, webinars, email marketing, online communities, influencer marketing, SEO, paid advertising, and referral programs.
   - Developed a structured plan to execute these strategies over the next three months, emphasizing initial steps such as content creation, social media engagement, and launching a freemium model.

**4. Technical Development and Workstation Expansion:**
   - **New Workstation Setup**: Added another laptop to our workstation, requiring the setup of the new computer environment.
   - **Git Installation and Repository Cloning**:
     - Downloaded and installed Git on the new Windows laptop.
     - Cloned the `TradingRobotPlug` repository from GitHub using the following commands:
       ```bash
       cd /path/to/your/desired/directory
       git clone https://github.com/dadudekc/TradingRobotPlug.git
       ```
     - Resolved indentation errors in `data_fetch_tab.py` that were present when we cloned the repository.
     - Ensured consistent use of tabs and spaces in the codebase.
   - **Dependency Management**:
     - Uninstalled conflicting versions of `gymnasium` and `stable-baselines3`.
     - Installed compatible versions (`gymnasium==0.28.1` and `stable-baselines3==2.3.2`) to resolve module import issues.
   - **Git Configuration and Version Control**: Configured Git username and email for committing changes. Cloned the repository and pulled changes to synchronize work across different computers.
   - **Code Testing**:
     - Created and executed test files for `MLRobotUtils`, `train_drl_model.py`, and `TradingEnv` classes.
     - Implemented comprehensive tests for data preprocessing, model training, and utility functions.

**5. GUI Improvement:**
   - Integrated risk management and backtesting functionalities into the application.
   - Enhanced the GUI using `tkinter` for a more user-friendly and intuitive interface.
   - Organized widgets using the `grid` layout and added padding for a cleaner look.
   - Added clear and descriptive labels for input fields and improved result display.

**6. Module Import Issue Resolution:**
   - Addressed the `ModuleNotFoundError` for `Scripts.Utilities` by dynamically adjusting the Python path in the script.

#### **Next Steps**
   - **Complete GUI Setup for Model Training Tab**: Finalize the setup for the model training tab to ensure all elements are properly configured.
   - **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error handling mechanisms within the GUI and backend processes.
   - **Debug Mode Enhancement**: Refine the debug mode functionality to provide more detailed logs and insights during development.
   - **Test Model Training Functionality**: Conduct thorough testing of the model training functionality to ensure all components work seamlessly.
   - **Implement Additional Features**: Integrate additional features as needed, such as automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Content Marketing**: Start writing and publishing blog posts, articles, and case studies on the website and relevant fintech blogs.
   - **Social Media Marketing**: Set up and optimize profiles on LinkedIn and Twitter. Begin sharing content and engaging with industry influencers.
   - **Webinars and Workshops**: Plan and schedule the first webinar to demonstrate the applicationâ€™s features and benefits.
   - **Email Marketing**: Build an initial email list and draft the first newsletter.
   - **Freemium Model**: Implement the freemium model and promote it through various channels.
   - **Partnerships**: Identify and reach out to potential influencers and educational institutions for collaborations.
   - **SEO Efforts**: Begin optimizing website content for relevant keywords and building backlinks.
   - **Further Testing and Development**: Continue refining the testing suite and address any additional issues that arise during development.
   - **Ensure Git is Recognized in PATH**: Confirm that Git is correctly added to the system PATH and recognized by PowerShell.
   - **Verify Git Installation**: Reopen PowerShell and run `git --version` to verify Git installation.
   - **Clone Repository Again**: After verifying Git installation, navigate to the desired directory and clone the repository.

#### **Skills Used**
   - **Market Analysis**: Conducting a detailed competitive analysis to understand the landscape and positioning.
   - **Strategic Planning**: Developing a comprehensive pricing strategy and user acquisition plan.
   - **Content Creation**: Planning for high-quality content to attract and engage users.
   - **Digital Marketing**: Utilizing social media, email marketing, and SEO techniques to reach potential users.
   - **Project Management**: Organizing and prioritizing tasks to ensure efficient execution of the plan.
   - **Version Control**: Configuring Git and managing repository changes.
   - **Software Testing**: Creating and running test scripts for various components of the application.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Identifying and resolving code errors to maintain code quality.
   - **GUI Design**: Enhancing the graphical user interface for better user experience.
   - **Dependency Management**: Handling package installations and resolving version conflicts.

By following this structured plan, we aim to build a strong foundation for acquiring our first 100 users and position our application as a revolutionary tool in the fintech space.
