### Catch Up Entry: Demonstrating Advanced Prompting and Ethical Hacking Skills

**Work Completed:**
- Developed and tested an advanced keylogger script that logs keystrokes and inserts random humorous messages, showcasing the ability to intercept and manipulate input data.
- Created a fake file deletion script that moves files to a hidden directory and restores them after a set period, simulating data loss while ensuring complete reversibility.
- Implemented a controlled system resource drain script that temporarily consumes CPU and memory resources to simulate a denial-of-service attack, then releases them.
- Built a custom desktop application using Tkinter that displays random jokes, demonstrating the ability to create deceptive yet harmless user interfaces.
- Set up a local DNS server with dnsmasq to redirect certain websites to funny or harmless pages, illustrating DNS hijacking techniques in a safe and controlled manner.
- Wrote a script to randomize desktop icon positions periodically, creating a confusing yet reversible user experience prank.

**Skills Used:**
- Advanced Python programming for scripting, automation, and system manipulation.
- Utilization of libraries such as `pynput` for keylogging, `ctypes` for system parameters, and `tkinter` for GUI development.
- Network configuration and DNS manipulation using dnsmasq.
- System resources management and threading in Python.
- Deep understanding of cybersecurity principles and ethical hacking techniques.
