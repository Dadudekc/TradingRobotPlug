### Journal Entry

**Date:** July 6, 2024  ------- 3:27 am------

**Summary:**
Today, I focused on getting the original files in my TradingRobotPlug project to work correctly. I encountered a major setback when the data fetching utility (`data_fetch_utils.py`) got deleted, so I had to recreate it from scratch. This involved setting up a `DataFetchUtils` class with functions for logging, ensuring directory existence, and handling data operations with CSV and SQL files.

**Progress:**
1. **Recreated DataFetchUtils:**
   - Implemented a new `DataFetchUtils` class with methods to set up a logger, ensure directory existence, save data to CSV, save data to SQL, and fetch data from SQL.

2. **Updated DataStore:**
   - Modified the `DataStore` class to use the new `DataFetchUtils` class for all data operations.
   - Ensured that all methods in `DataStore` properly utilize the utility functions provided by `DataFetchUtils`.

3. **Test Files:**
   - Created initial versions of test files for both `DataFetchUtils` and `DataStore`.
   - Encountered and fixed several syntax errors, though the test files still need more work to ensure comprehensive coverage and error-free execution.

4. **Realization About Config Handling:**
   - I just realized that the `config_handling.py` file is currently empty. This will need to be addressed to manage configuration settings effectively in the project.

**Challenges:**
- Multitasking between my day job and working on this project was tricky. It's funny because it reminded me of sneaking off to smoke weed in the past. Now, I'm sneaking in project work instead.
- Recreating `data_fetch_utils.py` from scratch was time-consuming but necessary to get the project back on track.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete and debug the test files for `DataFetchUtils` and `DataStore` to ensure all functionalities are thoroughly tested and working correctly.
- Run the tests to validate the implementations and make any necessary adjustments based on the test results.
- Address the empty `config_handling.py` file to manage configuration settings properly.
- Continue modularizing and refining the project for better organization and maintainability.

**Reflection:**
Despite the challenges, I'm making steady progress. Rebuilding the data fetching utility was a significant step forward, and once the test files are complete, I’ll have more confidence in the robustness of my code. The multitasking aspect adds a layer of complexity, but it's also a reminder of how far I've come in terms of prioritizing productive and meaningful work.

**Opportunity:**
Additionally, I have a job opportunity to train models with the company Outlier AI. This is an exciting prospect that aligns well with my current work and career goals.

**Project Structure:**
Here's the current structure of my project:

### Journal Entry

**Date:** July 6, 2024 (continued)

**Summary:**
Since the last update, I have focused on creating a project document, resolving import errors, and updating the file structure documentation. These steps were essential to ensure the project is well-documented and all components are functioning correctly.

**Progress:**

1. **Resolved Import Errors:**
   - At 3:27 am, I successfully resolved import errors in the test files, allowing the tests to run without issues.

2. **Created Project Document:**
   - Developed a comprehensive project document detailing the project's goals, recent work, and future plans.
   - The document includes a summary of the work done, the project's structure, and the next steps.

3. **Updated File Structure Documentation:**
   - Documented the current file structure at 3:36 pm, capturing the state of the project as accurately as possible given my multitasking across two jobs.

**Challenges:**
- Documenting the file structure while working two jobs was challenging, but I managed to capture the necessary details.
- Ensuring all test files had the correct imports and paths required careful attention to detail.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete and debug the test files for `nasdaq.py` and `alpha_vantage.py` to ensure all functionalities are thoroughly tested and working correctly.
- Develop a comprehensive data fetch GUI.
- Create a main file that integrates all data fetch features.
- Continue refining and modularizing the project for better organization and maintainability.
- Prepare for the job opportunity with Outlier AI, leveraging the work done on this project as part of my portfolio.

**Reflection:**
The progress made today, particularly resolving the import errors and creating the project documentation, marks a significant step forward. It reinforces the importance of documentation and testing in maintaining a robust and well-organized project. Multitasking remains a challenge, but it’s also a reminder of my commitment to both my professional responsibilities and personal projects.

```

2. **Data Fetching Enhancements:**
   - Updated the main data fetching script (`data_fetcher.py`) to improve logging, error handling, and ensure compatibility with various APIs (Alpha Vantage, Nasdaq, Polygon). This involved refining the URL construction and result extraction methods.
   - Introduced enhanced logging that includes the source of the data being fetched, making it easier to debug and understand where each piece of data originates.
   - Fixed issues related to fetching and filtering data by ensuring the DataFrame index is sorted correctly.

3. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Improved error messages for better clarity. For instance, the error logs now clearly indicate which API caused the error and provide a more detailed description of the error.
   - Added debug logs to trace the flow of data fetching and pinpoint where potential issues may arise.

4. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Ran tests using the updated `test_data_fetcher.py` script to ensure that data fetching and saving mechanisms work correctly.
   - Fixed several issues related to incorrect data fetching, specifically addressing problems with non-monotonic DatetimeIndexes and handling 404 errors from the Nasdaq API.

**Next Steps:**
- Further refine and optimize the data fetching scripts to handle edge cases and improve reliability.
- Continue building out test cases to cover more scenarios and ensure robustness.
- Begin working on integrating the data fetching capabilities into the main application logic.
- Document the changes and updates made during this session in the project documentation.

**Challenges:**
- Encountered issues with the Nasdaq API returning 404 errors. Need to verify the API endpoints and access credentials.
- Ensuring that data filtering works correctly with sorted indexes was a bit challenging but resolved successfully.

Overall, today’s session was highly productive, laying a strong foundation for further development and testing of the `TheTradingRobotPlug` project.
