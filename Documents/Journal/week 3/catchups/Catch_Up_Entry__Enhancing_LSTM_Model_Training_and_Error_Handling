            self.logger.info(f"Training completed. Model saved at {self.model_save_path}")
            model.save(self.model_save_path)

            y_pred_val = model.predict(X_val).flatten()
            mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_val)
            rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
            r2 = r2_score(y_val, y_pred_val)

            self.logger.info(f"Validation MSE: {mse:.2f}, RMSE: {rmse:.2f}, RÂ²: {r2:.2f}")
