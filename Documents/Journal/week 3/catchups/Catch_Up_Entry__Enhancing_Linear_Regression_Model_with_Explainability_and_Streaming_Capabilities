# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_Linear_Regression_Model_with_Explainability_and_Streaming_Capabilities**

---

## Work Completed
### Objectives and Goals:
- Integrate logging and project path management to ensure robustness and maintainability.
- Develop a Linear Regression model with hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and explainability features.
- Implement real-time data consumption and prediction capabilities using Kafka.

### Actions Taken:
- **Dynamic Path Setup**: Implemented dynamic root path setup to ensure that resource and log directories are correctly located regardless of where the script is executed.
- **Logging Configuration**: Set up detailed logging for debugging and tracking the model's progress, including saving logs to a file.
- **Conditional Imports**: Added conditional imports to handle different execution contexts (e.g., production vs. testing).
- **Model Training**: Implemented a Linear Regression model with hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV` and feature selection with `SelectFromModel`.
- **Explainability**: Integrated SHAP and LIME to provide insights into the model's predictions and feature importance.
- **Real-Time Data Consumption**: Added functionality to consume streaming data using Kafka and make real-time predictions with the trained model.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge**: Managing different paths and ensuring that all necessary directories (e.g., resources, logs) are correctly identified and accessible during execution.
  - **Breakthrough**: Implemented a robust dynamic path setup that adapts based on the script's location, resolving potential issues with missing or inaccessible directories.
- **Challenge**: Handling potential exceptions during model training, especially when working with complex pipelines and cross-validation.
  - **Breakthrough**: Integrated comprehensive error handling within the training pipeline, ensuring that errors are logged and handled gracefully without interrupting the workflow.

### Results and Impact:
- **Enhanced Robustness**: The script is now more robust and portable, with dynamic path handling ensuring that resources are always accessible.
- **Improved Logging**: Detailed logging facilitates easier debugging and provides a clear record of the model's training process.
- **Model Explainability**: The integration of SHAP and LIME provides valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing trust and transparency.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The Kafka-based streaming capability allows the model to make real-time predictions, broadening its application in live environments.

```python
# Function to set up dynamic paths and logging
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir))
sys.path.append(project_root)

resources_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'resources')
log_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'logs')
os.makedirs(resources_path, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(log_path, exist_ok=True)

log_file = os.path.join(log_path, 'application.log')
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=log_file,
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming**: Utilized for scripting the model training, explainability, and streaming capabilities.
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)**: Employed for training a Ridge regression model with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Explainability Tools (SHAP, LIME)**: Integrated SHAP and LIME to enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions.
- **Real-Time Streaming (Kafka)**: Used Kafka to implement real-time data consumption and prediction.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Applied advanced logging techniques to ensure detailed tracking and error handling throughout the model's lifecycle.

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes**: Learned the importance of setting up dynamic paths and robust logging to ensure that scripts can run in various environments without path issues. Gained deeper insights into model explainability using SHAP and LIME.
- **Unexpected Challenges**: Encountered issues with path handling, particularly when dealing with nested directories. Addressed this by implementing a dynamic path setup that adjusts based on the script's location.
- **Future Application**: Plan to apply the dynamic path setup and logging techniques to other scripts in the project to enhance portability and debugging capabilities. The integration of SHAP and LIME will be considered for other models to improve interpretability.

## To-Do
- **Complete Unit Tests**: Finalize the remaining unit tests for the `linear_regression.py` script by [specific date].
- **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect the changes in the `linear_regression.py` script and explainability features.
- **Feature Implementation**: Start working on the caching mechanism for API responses to reduce redundancy in data fetching.
- **Refactor Code**: Improve the structure and readability of the explainability methods (SHAP and LIME) to enhance maintainability.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Dynamic Path and Logging Setup

```python
# Set up dynamic paths and logging configuration
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir))
sys.path.append(project_root)

resources_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'resources')
log_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'logs')
os.makedirs(resources_path, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(log_path, exist_ok=True)

log_file = os.path.join(log_path, 'application.log')
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=log_file,
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```

### Model Training with Explainability

```python
# Training the Ridge regression model with feature selection
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('ridge', Ridge())
])

param_grid = {'ridge__alpha': np.logspace(-4, 0, 100)}
randomized_search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    pipeline,
    param_distributions=param_grid,
    n_iter=50,
    cv=5,
    scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
    verbose=2,
    n_jobs=-1
)
randomized_search.fit(X_train_selected, y_train)

# SHAP explainability
explainer = shap.Explainer(self.best_model.named_steps['ridge'], X_train_selected)
shap_values = explainer(X_val_selected)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values.values, X_val_selected, show=False)
plt.savefig('shap_summary_plot.png')
```
