# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Integrating_Model_Training_Utilities_and_Resolving_Learning_Rate_Scheduler_Issues**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
The primary objective was to integrate utility functions from the `model_training_utils.py` module into the neural network training script (`neural_network.py`). The goal was to ensure consistency in data processing, logging, and error handling across the project while resolving an error related to the learning rate scheduler in the training script.

### Actions Taken:
- **Integration of Utility Functions:** Key utility functions like logging, data loading, and preprocessing from `model_training_utils.py` were integrated into the neural network training script. This helped in standardizing processes across the project.
- **Path Management:** Ensured that paths were consistently handled across the scripts, particularly when referencing the project root and utility directories.
- **Error Handling and Debugging:** Focused on refining error handling, specifically related to the learning rate scheduler. Adjusted the `scheduler` function to ensure the output was a float, which resolved the issue.
- **Refactoring of `neural_network.py`:** Improved the structure of the neural network training script by using utility functions for preprocessing and logging, and ensured that all operations were consistent with project standards.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge:** The major challenge was a `ValueError` that occurred due to the `LearningRateScheduler` callback receiving a non-float value from the `scheduler` function.
- **Breakthrough:** The issue was resolved by explicitly converting the learning rate to a float using `float(lr * tf.math.exp(-0.1).numpy())`. This simple yet crucial change ensured the scheduler returned a valid float, allowing the training process to proceed without errors.

### Results and Impact:
- The integration of utility functions has significantly improved code maintainability and consistency. By standardizing logging and preprocessing, the scripts are now easier to manage and debug.
- The resolution of the learning rate scheduler issue unblocked the training process, allowing the neural network model to be trained successfully.
- These improvements contribute to a more robust and scalable project infrastructure, ensuring that future development and debugging efforts will be more streamlined.

## Lessons Learned

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Scheduler Functionality:** Gained a deeper understanding of how learning rate schedulers work within TensorFlow/Keras and the importance of ensuring that callback functions return the correct data types.
- **Utility Integration:** Learned the importance of integrating utility functions to maintain consistency across large projects, which helps in improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling:** Improved techniques for handling and logging errors, particularly in scenarios involving deep learning frameworks.

### Unexpected Challenges:
- The non-float output from the learning rate scheduler was an unexpected issue that required careful inspection and debugging. This highlighted the need to thoroughly check data types when working with callbacks in TensorFlow/Keras.

### Future Application:
- **Improved Debugging:** The lessons learned from debugging the scheduler function will be applied to future issues, ensuring that similar errors are caught and resolved more quickly.
- **Enhanced Code Structure:** The integration of utility functions will continue to be a priority in future development, ensuring that all scripts within the project adhere to the same high standards of structure and organization.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Scheduler Function in Neural Network Trainer

```python
def scheduler(self, epoch, lr):
    if epoch < 10:
        return lr
    else:
        # Convert to float to avoid ValueError
        return float(lr * tf.math.exp(-0.1).numpy())
```

**Context:**
This function adjusts the learning rate during model training. The key change was converting the output to a float to ensure compatibility with TensorFlow's `LearningRateScheduler` callback.

### Integration of Utility Functions

```python
from model_training_utils import (
    LoggerHandler, load_model_from_file, save_predictions, save_metadata,
    preprocess_data, detect_models, DataLoader, DataPreprocessor, ConfigManager
)

# Logger setup
logger_handler = LoggerHandler()
logger = logger_handler.logger

# Data Preprocessing Example
data_preprocessor = DataPreprocessor(logger_handler, ConfigManager())
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = data_preprocessor.preprocess_data(
    data,
    target_column='close',
    date_column='date',
    lag_sizes=[1, 2, 3, 5, 10],
    window_sizes=[5, 10, 20],
    scaler_type='StandardScaler'
)
```

**Context:**
This code demonstrates the integration of logging and data preprocessing utility functions into the neural network training script, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
