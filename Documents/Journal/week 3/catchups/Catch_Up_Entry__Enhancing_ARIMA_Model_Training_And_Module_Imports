# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_ARIMA_Model_Training_And_Module_Imports**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
The main objectives for this session were to:
- Resolve module import errors in the ARIMA model training script.
- Debug and enhance the ARIMA model training process to ensure successful execution without convergence issues.
- Improve the project structure by validating the correct setup of `sys.path` and confirming that all necessary utilities and configurations are accessible.

### Actions Taken:
- **Module Import Debugging:** 
  - Adjusted the `sys.path` to ensure the `Utilities` directory was properly added to the path, allowing the `DataStore` and `ConfigManager` modules to be imported without errors.
  - Confirmed the project root path and dynamically adjusted the import paths based on the directory structure.
  
- **ARIMA Model Training Debugging:**
  - Initiated ARIMA model training with enhanced logging to track the training steps, forecasts, and any issues encountered.
  - Addressed a `NameError` by ensuring all necessary libraries (e.g., `pandas` as `pd`) were correctly imported.
  - Managed convergence warnings that occurred during model training by logging detailed information, including the Maximum Likelihood optimization warnings.

- **Logging Enhancements:** 
  - Implemented comprehensive logging to capture each step of the ARIMA model training, including train/test data details, model parameters, and errors encountered.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenges:**
  - Encountered frequent convergence warnings during ARIMA model training, which required careful monitoring and adjustments.
  - Initial issues with module imports due to incorrect paths in the script, which were resolved by dynamically adjusting the Python path.

- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Successfully resolved the module import issues by correctly setting the `sys.path`, ensuring that all utilities were accessible.
  - Managed to run the ARIMA model training process, logging detailed debug information that will aid in future optimization efforts.

### Results and Impact:
- The ARIMA model training script is now functional, with detailed logging capturing the process. Although convergence issues remain, the model completes its training, providing forecasts and performance metrics.
- The improved project structure and logging will make future debugging and optimization more straightforward, contributing to the overall stability and reliability of the trading robot project.

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Gained deeper insights into managing Python imports and ensuring that project modules are correctly configured, particularly in complex projects with multiple directories.
  - Learned how to handle convergence issues in ARIMA models by adjusting parameters and using detailed logging to track progress.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - The persistent convergence warnings during ARIMA model training highlighted the need for more robust parameter tuning and possibly exploring alternative models.

- **Future Application:**
  - Will apply the lessons learned in managing project paths and module imports to other parts of the project to ensure consistent execution across all scripts.
  - Plan to explore advanced parameter tuning techniques for ARIMA models to reduce convergence issues and improve model accuracy.

## To-Do
- **ARIMA Model Optimization:** Experiment with different ARIMA parameters and solvers to improve model convergence and accuracy.
- **Complete Logging Enhancements:** Finalize and standardize logging across all scripts for consistent debugging information.
- **Documentation Update:** Document the changes made to the ARIMA model training script and the project structure adjustments.
- **Explore Alternative Models:** Consider testing other time series models (e.g., SARIMA, Prophet) to compare performance with ARIMA.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Adjusting sys.path for Correct Module Imports

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Adjust import path based on your project structure
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parents[3]  # Assuming project root is three levels up

# Add the 'Utilities' directory to sys.path
utilities_dir = project_root / 'Scripts' / 'Utilities'
sys.path.append(str(utilities_dir))

# Debug print to confirm the path
print("Corrected Project root path:", project_root)
print("Adding Utilities directory to sys.path:", utilities_dir)

# Import necessary modules
from data_store import DataStore
```

### Logging in ARIMA Model Training

```python
def setup_logger(self):
    logger = logging.getLogger(f'ARIMA_{self.symbol}')
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    ch.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(ch)
    return logger

def background_training(self):
    self.display_message("Starting ARIMA training background process...", "INFO")
    # Further processing and logging here
```
