# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_Sequence_Creation_Issues_And_ARIMA_Model_Enhancements**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
- Resolve errors encountered during sequence creation in the LSTM model training script.
- Address issues in the ARIMA model trainer related to the `reshape` method and incorrect indexing.
- Ensure that the model training processes run smoothly without errors, and log detailed information for debugging.

### Actions Taken
- **Debugged LSTM Sequence Creation:** Analyzed and refined the `create_sequences` function to handle potential `KeyError` and `IndexError` scenarios. Added logging to track data lengths and sequence creation progress, ensuring that data and target arrays are correctly aligned.
- **Updated ARIMA Model Trainer:** Fixed the issue where the `reshape` method was mistakenly called on a Pandas `Series` object instead of a `numpy` array. Ensured that the correct data types were used for scaling and inverse transformations.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenges:**
  - The `KeyError` encountered during sequence creation in the LSTM model was difficult to trace due to the lack of detailed logging.
  - The ARIMA model trainer faced issues with incorrect data manipulation, causing errors during the model update and prediction steps.
  
- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Implemented detailed logging and debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues with the sequence creation process.
  - Corrected the data processing steps in the ARIMA model trainer, ensuring proper handling of `Series` and `numpy` arrays.

### Results and Impact
- The LSTM model training script now correctly handles sequence creation without encountering `KeyError` or `IndexError`.
- The ARIMA model trainer successfully completes the background training process, with accurate predictions and logging of performance metrics.

```python
# Updated create_sequences function to handle errors and ensure correct indexing
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    data_length = len(data)
    target_length = len(target)

    if data_length != target_length:
        raise ValueError(f"Data and target lengths do not match. Data length: {data_length}, Target length: {target_length}")

    if data_length <= time_steps:
        raise ValueError(f"Not enough data to create sequences with time_steps={time_steps}. Data length: {data_length}")

    for i in range(data_length - time_steps):
        try:
            x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
            y = target[i + time_steps]
            xs.append(x)
            ys.append(y)
        except KeyError as e:
            logger.error(f"KeyError encountered at index {i + time_steps}: {e}")
            raise ValueError(f"Error creating sequence at index {i}: {e}") from e
        except IndexError as e:
            logger.error(f"IndexError encountered at index {i + time_steps}: {e}")
            raise ValueError(f"Error creating sequence at index {i}: {e}") from e
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error encountered at index {i + time_steps}: {e}")
            raise ValueError(f"Unexpected error creating sequence at index {i}: {e}") from e
                
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

    xs, ys = [], []
    if len(data) <= time_steps:
