## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
The primary objective of this session was to improve the system's performance by optimizing virtual memory settings. The goal was to configure the paging file size based on the installed 12 GB of RAM to enhance system responsiveness, particularly when running multiple tasks or handling large datasets.

### Actions Taken:
- **RAM Identification:** Verified the system's installed RAM (12 GB) using tools like System Information and Task Manager.
- **Virtual Memory Configuration:** Adjusted the virtual memory settings by setting the Initial size to 12288 MB (12 GB) and the Maximum size to 24576 MB (24 GB), based on best practices for performance optimization.
- **System Restart:** Restarted the computer to apply the new virtual memory settings, ensuring the changes took effect.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge:** Determining the optimal virtual memory settings to avoid potential performance degradation or instability.
- **Breakthrough:** Successfully applied the appropriate virtual memory configuration, resulting in improved system performance and reduced lag during resource-intensive tasks.

### Results and Impact:
- **Results:** The system's performance improved significantly, especially during multitasking. The optimized virtual memory settings allowed for better management of memory resources, leading to smoother operation.
- **Impact:** This enhancement positively affected the overall project workflow by minimizing delays and improving the efficiency of development and testing processes.
