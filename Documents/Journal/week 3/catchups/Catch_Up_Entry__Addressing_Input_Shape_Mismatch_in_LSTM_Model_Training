# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Addressing_Input_Shape_Mismatch_in_LSTM_Model_Training"**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**  
  The main objective of this session was to identify and resolve an issue related to input shape mismatch encountered during the evaluation phase of training a Bidirectional LSTM model. The goal was to ensure that the model's input shape configuration aligns with the data being used during training and evaluation.

- **Actions Taken:**  
  - Investigated the error related to input shape mismatch by examining the model configuration and the input data shape.
  - Reviewed and modified the input layer of the LSTM model to ensure it correctly handles 3D input data, specifically with shapes `(batch_size, time_steps, features)`.
  - Implemented logging statements to validate the shapes of input data during both training and evaluation phases.
  - Reconfigured the LSTM model using the correct input shape and rebuilt the model accordingly.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**  
  - **Challenges:** The primary challenge was deciphering the cause of the input shape mismatch error that was hindering model evaluation. This involved deep diving into both the model configuration and the input data preprocessing steps.
  - **Breakthroughs:** The breakthrough came when it was identified that the LSTM layer's input shape was incorrectly specified, leading to the mismatch. Correcting the input shape configuration in the model resolved the issue.

- **Results and Impact:**  
  After reconfiguring the model with the correct input shape, the model successfully trained without encountering input shape errors. This adjustment has significantly improved the robustness of the model and its ability to handle the input data correctly during both training and evaluation.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting and model configuration, including the restructuring of the LSTM model input layer.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Employed for building and training the Bidirectional LSTM model, managing the complexities of input shapes in sequential models.
- **Logging:** Implemented to trace data shapes during model training and evaluation, aiding in debugging and validation.
- **Error Debugging:** Enhanced skills in identifying and resolving shape mismatch errors in deep learning models.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  Gained a deeper understanding of how input shapes must be carefully managed in LSTM and other sequential models, especially when handling time-series data with multiple features. Correctly setting up the input layer is crucial to avoid shape mismatch errors during training and evaluation.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**  
  The input shape mismatch error was initially challenging to diagnose due to the model expecting a different shape than what was provided. The solution required meticulous checking of both model configuration and the data preprocessing pipeline.

- **Future Application:**  
  This experience will lead to more rigorous checks of input shapes in future model configurations. Ensuring that the input layer correctly matches the data's shape will be a standard practice in future projects to avoid similar issues.

## To-Do

- **Refine Model Evaluation:** Re-evaluate the model after confirming that all input shapes are correctly handled.
- **Enhance Logging:** Improve logging to provide more detailed insights into data flow through the model during training and evaluation.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the changes made to the LSTM model configuration and the reasoning behind these changes.
- **Code Review:** Schedule a code review session to ensure that the recent changes adhere to best practices and project standards.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Adjusted LSTM Model Configuration

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout, Bidirectional
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, params):
        model = Sequential()
        for layer in params['layers']:
            if layer['type'] == 'bidirectional_lstm':
                model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(layer['units'], return_sequences=layer['return_sequences'], input_shape=input_shape if not model.layers else None)))
            elif layer['type'] == 'batch_norm':
                model.add(BatchNormalization())
            elif layer['type'] == 'dropout':
                model.add(Dropout(layer['rate']))
            elif layer['type'] == 'dense':
                model.add(Dense(layer['units'], activation=layer['activation']))
        model.add(Dense(1))  # Ensure the final layer produces a single output per sequence
        model.compile(optimizer=params['optimizer'], loss=params['loss'])
        return model
```

### Data Shape Logging

```python
self.logger.info(f"X_train_seq shape: {X_train_seq.shape}")  # Logging the shape during training
self.logger.info(f"X_val_seq shape: {X_val_seq.shape}")      # Logging the shape during validation
```
