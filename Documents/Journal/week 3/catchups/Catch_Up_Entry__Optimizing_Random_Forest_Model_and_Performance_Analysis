# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Optimizing_Random_Forest_Model_and_Performance_Analysis**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
- The primary objective was to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model to achieve the best possible performance on the validation dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R².

### Actions Taken:
- Ran the Random Forest model multiple times using different hyperparameter configurations to identify the best set of parameters.
- Utilized a hyperparameter optimization tool to automate the search for optimal parameters.
- Analyzed the model's performance through various metrics and identified the best-performing model configuration.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenges:** Encountered a negative R² score, indicating that the model's predictions were not a good fit for the data. This was a significant challenge, requiring a deeper review of the data and model.
- **Breakthroughs:** Successfully identified the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which led to the best validation performance metrics observed during the session.

### Results and Impact:
- The best model was configured with `n_estimators=35`, `max_depth=30`, `min_samples_split=5`, and `min_samples_leaf=3`.
- The final model produced a Validation MSE of 0.06, RMSE of 0.25, MAE of 0.19, MAPE of 175.12, and R² of -0.07.
- The feature importances were computed, providing insights into which features contributed most to the model's predictions.
- The session provided a strong baseline model configuration that can be further refined and used for future training sessions.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting the model training and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Random Forest Algorithm:** Applied Random Forest for regression tasks and fine-tuned the model to achieve optimal performance.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Leveraged automated hyperparameter search to identify the best model configuration.
- **Data Analysis:** Performed in-depth analysis of model performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Used logging to track the model training progress and capture important metrics for later analysis.

## Lessons Learned

### Learning Outcomes:
- Gained a deeper understanding of how hyperparameter optimization can significantly influence model performance.
- Recognized the importance of evaluating a wide range of hyperparameters to identify the best configuration.
- Learned that negative R² scores can be indicative of issues with model fit, requiring further investigation into the data and model assumptions.

### Unexpected Challenges:
- The unexpectedly high MAPE and negative R² scores were a challenge. These metrics highlighted potential issues with the model's ability to generalize well to the data.
- Addressed this by reviewing the data preprocessing steps and considering additional feature engineering.

### Future Application:
- These lessons will influence future model training sessions by ensuring a more thorough data review and possibly exploring alternative model configurations or algorithms if similar issues arise.
- Consider implementing more robust cross-validation techniques to better estimate the model's generalization performance.

- **Brainstorming:** Explore alternative models such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost if Random Forest does not yield significant improvements after further tuning.
- **Feedback:** The current approach to hyperparameter optimization worked well, but integrating it with cross-validation could provide even more reliable results.
