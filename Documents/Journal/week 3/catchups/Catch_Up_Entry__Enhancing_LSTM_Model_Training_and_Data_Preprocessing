---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
The primary objective of this session was to resolve issues related to inconsistent sample sizes encountered during LSTM model training. Additionally, improvements were needed in the data preprocessing pipeline to ensure reliable and accurate data handling before feeding it into the model.

### Actions Taken
- **LSTM Model Trainer Enhancements:**
  - Updated the `LSTMModelTrainer` class to include robust error handling during model training and evaluation.
  - Improved the method for creating sequences of data to ensure consistent sample sizes across training and validation datasets.
  - Integrated additional logging to provide better insights into the training process, including data shape and performance metrics.

- **Data Preprocessing Improvements:**
  - Updated the `DataHandler` class to include comprehensive logging for each step in the data preprocessing pipeline.
  - Improved the management of non-numeric data by converting it to NaN values and applying imputation techniques.
  - Enhanced the creation of lag and rolling window features to avoid data loss due to NaN removal.

- **Model Configuration and Training:**
  - Implemented a more flexible model configuration for LSTM models, allowing for different types of layers, such as Bidirectional LSTM and Attention layers.
  - Updated the training loop to include callbacks for early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing, ensuring that the best model is saved.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenge:** Inconsistent sample sizes during LSTM model training led to errors in the training process.
  - **Breakthrough:** The issue was resolved by refining the sequence creation method in the `LSTMModelTrainer` class, ensuring that the data fed into the model had consistent dimensions across training and validation sets.

- **Challenge:** Managing non-numeric data during preprocessing posed challenges in maintaining data integrity.
  - **Breakthrough:** The solution involved converting non-numeric data to NaN values and applying imputation, which improved the quality of the data before it was scaled and split.

### Results and Impact
The improvements made in this session significantly enhanced the robustness of the LSTM model training process. The logging and error-handling mechanisms provide better insights into the training pipeline, making it easier to diagnose issues and ensure consistent model performance. These changes contribute to the overall progress of the project by ensuring that the models are trained on well-prepared and consistent data, leading to more reliable predictions.

def create_lag_features(self, df, column_name, lag_sizes):
    for lag_days in lag_sizes:
        df[f'{column_name}_lag_{lag_days}'] = df[column_name].shift(lag_days)
    df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)
    return df
```

### LSTMModelTrainer Class

```python
# Example of sequence creation in the LSTMModelTrainer class
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
        y = target.iloc[i + time_steps]
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
