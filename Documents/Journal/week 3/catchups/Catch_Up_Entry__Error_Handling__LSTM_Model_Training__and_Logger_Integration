## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
The main objectives were to:
- Resolve the `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` error occurring during LSTM model training.
- Refactor the LSTM model training script to improve logging and error handling.
- Ensure that the LSTM model and its configurations are correctly implemented and logged.

### Actions Taken
- **Refactored the `LSTMModelConfig` class** to ensure the LSTM model is properly configured and returned without attempting to subscript the model object.
- **Moved all logging functionality** into the `LSTMModelTrainer` class, ensuring that the logger is only used where appropriate.
- **Corrected the model output layer** in `LSTMModelConfig` to ensure it outputs a single dense layer suitable for regression tasks.
- **Updated the `model_training_main.py` script** to utilize the refactored LSTM model and logging infrastructure, ensuring a smooth and error-free execution.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenge:** The primary challenge was resolving the `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` error. This required careful examination of how the model was being constructed and handled within the script.
- **Breakthrough:** The breakthrough came from realizing that the error was caused by attempting to index the `Model` object directly. Refactoring the code to avoid such operations resolved the issue.

### Results and Impact
- **Outcome:** The LSTM model training now runs smoothly without errors. The logging is robust, capturing all significant events during the model training process.
- **Impact:** These changes significantly improved the reliability and maintainability of the model training script, ensuring that future development can proceed without encountering similar issues.

**Example Code Snippet:**
```python
class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, params):
        inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
        x = inputs
        for layer in params['layers']:
            if layer['type'] == 'bidirectional_lstm':
                x = Bidirectional(LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer['return_sequences'],
                                       kernel_regularizer=layer['kernel_regularizer']))(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'attention':
                x = Attention()([x, x])
            elif layer['type'] == 'batch_norm':
                x = BatchNormalization()(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'dropout':
                x = Dropout(rate=layer['rate'])(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'dense':
                x = Dense(units=layer['units'], activation=layer['activation'],
                          kernel_regularizer=layer['kernel_regularizer'])(x)

        outputs = Dense(1)(x)  # Correctly defined output layer for regression
        model = Model(inputs, outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer=params['optimizer'], loss=params['loss'])
        return model
```

## Code Snippets and Context
### LSTM Model Configuration
The following snippet outlines the correct way to set up and compile the LSTM model within the `LSTMModelConfig` class:

```python
class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, params):
        inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
        x = inputs
        # Layer setup omitted for brevity
        outputs = Dense(1)(x)  # Final output layer defined for regression
        model = Model(inputs, outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer=params['optimizer'], loss=params['loss'])
        return model
```

### Training the LSTM Model
The snippet below shows how the LSTM model is trained, with logging and error handling fully integrated:

```python
class LSTMModelTrainer:
    def train_lstm(self, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, model_config, epochs=100):
        """Train an LSTM model."""
        self.logger.info("Starting LSTM model training...")
        try:
            model = LSTMModelConfig.lstm_model(input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), params=model_config)
            model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=epochs, batch_size=32)
            self.logger.info("LSTM model training complete.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error occurred during model training: {e}")
```
