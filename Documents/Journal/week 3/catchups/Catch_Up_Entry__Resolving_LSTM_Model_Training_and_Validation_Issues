**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_LSTM_Model_Training_and_Validation_Issues**

---

## Work Completed
**Objectives and Goals:**
- Resolve the mismatch between the length of validation targets (`y_val`) and the predicted values (`y_pred_val`) in the LSTM model training.
- Ensure the LSTM model training process is robust and error-free.
- Enhance logging to debug the shapes of datasets and predictions during model training.

**Actions Taken:**
1. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Added logging to track the shapes of `X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, `y_val`, and predictions to identify where the shape mismatch occurs.
   - Implemented additional logs to monitor the training process and data preprocessing steps.

2. **Reviewed and Adjusted Data Preparation:**
   - Checked the data sequence creation to ensure consistent shapes between input data and target variables.
   - Ensured the model's output layer and reshaping operations are correctly implemented.

3. **Model Training Adjustments:**
   - Revised the model configuration to ensure the final layer has a single unit.
   - Added more robust error handling and logging during the training phase to capture any issues promptly.

**Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
- **Challenges:** 
  - Encountered a persistent issue with inconsistent numbers of samples between `y_val` and `y_pred_val`.
  - Debugging the model configuration and data preparation processes to identify the root cause of the shape mismatch.

- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Enhanced logging provided clear insights into where the shape mismatch was occurring, allowing for targeted debugging and resolution.
  - Identified and corrected the sequence creation and model output configuration to ensure consistent shapes.

**Results and Impact:**
- Successfully resolved the shape mismatch issue between `y_val` and `y_pred_val`.
- Improved the robustness and reliability of the LSTM model training process.
- Enhanced logging and debugging processes for more efficient troubleshooting in future tasks.

        self.logger.info(f"True y_val shape: {y_val.shape}")
