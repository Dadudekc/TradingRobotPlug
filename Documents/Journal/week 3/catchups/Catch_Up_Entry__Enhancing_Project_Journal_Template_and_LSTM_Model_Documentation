## Code Snippets and Context

### Updated Sequence Creation Function
```python
def create_sequences_with_target(data, target, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    targets = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        sequences.append(data[i:i + seq_length])
        targets.append(target[i + seq_length])
    return np.array(sequences), np.array(targets)
```

### Updated `train_lstm_model` Function
```python
def train_lstm_model(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    """Train an LSTM model."""
    logger.info("Training LSTM model...")
    time_steps = 10  # Define the number of time steps for the LSTM input

    X_train_seq, y_train_seq = create_sequences_with_target(X_train, y_train, time_steps)
    X_val_seq, y_val_seq = create_sequences_with_target(X_val, y_val, time_steps)

    logger.debug(f"X_train_seq shape: {X_train_seq.shape}, y_train_seq shape: {y_train_seq.shape}")
    logger.debug(f"X_val_seq shape: {X_val_seq.shape}, y_val_seq shape: {y_val_seq.shape}")

    if X_train_seq.shape[0] != y_train_seq.shape[0] or X_val_seq.shape[0] != y_val_seq.shape[0]:
        raise ValueError(f"Shape mismatch between X and y sequences: X_train_seq {X_train_seq.shape}, y_train_seq {y_train_seq.shape}, X_val_seq {X_val_seq.shape}, y_val_seq {y_val_seq.shape}")

    model_config = LSTMModelConfig.lstm_model(input_shape=(X_train_seq.shape[1], X_train_seq.shape[2]))
    lstm_trainer = LSTMModelTrainer(logger)

    lstm_trainer.train_lstm(X_train_seq, y_train_seq, X_val_seq, y_val_seq, model_config)
    logger.info("LSTM training complete")
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna
```python
def objective(trial):
    model_config = {
        'input_shape': (time_steps, len(selected_features)),
        'layers': [
            {'type': 'bidirectional_lstm', 'units': trial.suggest_int('units_lstm', 50, 200), 'return_sequences': True, 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)},
            {'type': 'attention'},
            {'type': 'batch_norm'},
            {'type': 'dropout', 'rate': trial.suggest_float('dropout_rate', 0.2, 0.5)},
            {'type': 'dense', 'units': trial.suggest_int('units_dense', 10, 50), 'activation': 'relu', 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)}
        ],
        'optimizer': trial.suggest_categorical('optimizer', ['adam', 'sgd', 'rmsprop', 'adadelta']),
        'loss': 'mean_squared_error'
    }
    model = trainer.train_lstm(X_train_scaled, y_train, X_val_scaled, y_val, model_config, epochs=50)
    if model is None:
        raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned()
    y_pred_val = model.predict(X_val_scaled).flatten()
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_val)
    return mse

study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```
