**Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_LSTM_Model_Training_and_Debugging_Data_Preprocessing_Issues**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
The objective for this session was to enhance the LSTM model training pipeline, address issues related to data preprocessing, and ensure that the model training process runs smoothly without errors related to inconsistent sample sizes.

### Actions Taken
- **Data Preprocessing Improvements:**
  - Updated the `DataHandler` class to enhance logging and error handling during the preprocessing steps.
  - Improved the creation of lag and rolling window features, ensuring that non-numeric data is properly converted and handled.
  - Implemented more robust imputation for missing values using `SimpleImputer`.

- **LSTM Model Configuration:**
  - Refined the LSTM model architecture to include additional layers such as Bidirectional LSTM, Attention, Batch Normalization, and Dropout.
  - Configured a comprehensive set of callbacks during model training, including `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and `LearningRateScheduler`.

- **Debugging Sample Size Inconsistencies:**
  - Identified and resolved the issue causing inconsistent numbers of samples during model training by ensuring proper sequence creation and preprocessing steps.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenges:**
  - Encountered issues with inconsistent sample sizes during model training, leading to errors that needed thorough investigation and debugging.
  - The preprocessing step sometimes resulted in empty datasets due to excessive NaN values after creating lag and rolling window features.

- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Successfully resolved the sample size inconsistency by adjusting the sequence creation method to ensure that the target data is correctly aligned with the input sequences.
  - Enhanced the robustness of the preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that it can handle a variety of edge cases, including missing or incomplete data.

### Results and Impact
The enhancements made to the LSTM model training process have resulted in a more stable and reliable pipeline. The improvements in data preprocessing ensure that the model receives clean, well-prepared input, leading to better training outcomes. The project is now on track to achieve more consistent and accurate model training results.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Data Preprocessing Enhancements

```python
# Function to create lag features in the DataHandler class
def create_lag_features(self, df, column_name, lag_sizes):
    for lag_days in lag_sizes:
        df[f'{column_name}_lag_{lag_days}'] = df[column_name].shift(lag_days)
    df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    df.fillna(method='bfill', inplace=True)
    self.log(f"Lag features created for column '{column_name}' with lag sizes {lag_sizes}.")
    return df
```

### LSTM Model Training Configuration

```python
# LSTM model configuration with layers and callbacks
model_config = {
    'layers': [
        {'type': 'bidirectional_lstm', 'units': 100, 'return_sequences': True, 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)},
        {'type': 'attention'},
        {'type': 'batch_norm'},
        {'type': 'dropout', 'rate': 0.3},
        {'type': 'dense', 'units': 50, 'activation': 'relu', 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)}
