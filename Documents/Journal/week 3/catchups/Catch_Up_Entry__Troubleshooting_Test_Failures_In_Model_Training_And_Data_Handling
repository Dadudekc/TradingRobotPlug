# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Troubleshooting_Test_Failures_In_Model_Training_And_Data_Handling**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** The main goal was to resolve the issues encountered in the unit tests for the model training scripts and data handling functions. This included fixing the `test_detect_data_file`, `test_generate_predictions`, and `test_train_advanced_lstm` tests.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated the `test_detect_data_file` test to properly compare the IDs of `MagicMock` objects instead of comparing the objects directly.
  - Ensured that the `test_generate_predictions` test correctly mocks the `pd.read_csv` function and verified that it is called within the code.
  - Investigated the conditions leading to the failure of the `train_lstm` method call in the `test_train_advanced_lstm` test and adjusted the mock setup to ensure the method is triggered correctly.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - The major challenge was properly setting up the mocks to simulate real conditions that would allow the methods under test to be invoked as expected. A significant breakthrough was understanding that comparing `MagicMock` objects directly in `test_detect_data_file` led to false negatives, and the solution was to compare their string representations or IDs.
  
- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The updated tests now more accurately reflect the expected behavior of the scripts. Although some tests are still failing, the root causes have been identified, and steps have been taken to address these issues. This progress ensures that the project remains on track and that the code's reliability is continually improving.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting the unit tests and refactoring the code to handle edge cases in testing scenarios.
- **Unit Testing with `unittest`:** Employed to ensure code reliability, with a focus on mocking and asserting correct function behavior.
- **Mocking with `unittest.mock`:** Applied to simulate external dependencies and control test conditions, particularly for file handling and method calls.
- **Debugging:** Enhanced debugging techniques to trace and resolve issues within the test suite.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** Learned the importance of correctly setting up mocks and understanding how different parts of the code interact during testing. Additionally, comparing `MagicMock` objects directly can lead to unexpected failures, so it is better to compare their attributes or string representations.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** Encountered issues where the `MagicMock` objects were not behaving as expected, leading to failed comparisons. Addressing this required a deeper understanding of how mocking works in Python's `unittest` framework.
  
- **Future Application:** This experience will influence future testing strategies, emphasizing the need to carefully design test cases and mocks to ensure they accurately reflect the scenarios being tested. It also highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the testing tools used.

## To-Do

- **Resolve Remaining Test Failures:** Continue working on the `test_generate_predictions` and `test_train_advanced_lstm` tests to ensure they pass as expected.
- **Enhance Test Coverage:** Add more test cases to cover edge cases and ensure robustness across the project.
- **Refactor Mocking Setup:** Refactor the mocking setup to be more reusable and consistent across different tests.
- **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect the recent changes and improvements in the test suite.
- **Code Review:** Schedule a code review to verify the quality and effectiveness of the recent changes.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Data File Detection Test

```python
def test_detect_data_file(self):
    # Mocking rglob to return paths that "exist"
    mock_files = [MagicMock(), MagicMock()]
    mock_files[0].stat.return_value.st_mtime = 100
    mock_files[1].stat.return_value.st_mtime = 200

    with patch('model_training_main.Path.rglob', return_value=mock_files):
        detected_file = detect_data_file(self.test_data_dir, file_extension='csv')
        self.assertEqual(detected_file, str(mock_files[1]))  # Compare string representations if that's the return type
```

### Generate Predictions Test

```python
def test_generate_predictions(self):
    with patch('model_training_main.detect_models', return_value={'LSTM': 'path_to_lstm_model'}) as mock_detect_models, \
         patch('model_training_main.detect_data_file', return_value='path_to_data_file.csv') as mock_detect_data_file, \
         patch('model_training_main.pd.read_csv', return_value=MagicMock()) as mock_read_csv, \
         patch('model_training_main.basicLSTMModelTrainer') as MockLSTMTrainer:
        
        mock_trainer_instance = MockLSTMTrainer.return_value
        mock_trainer_instance.train_lstm.return_value = (MagicMock(), MagicMock())

        generate_predictions(self.test_model_dir, self.test_data_dir, output_format='parquet', output_dir=self.test_output_dir, parallel=False)
        mock_detect_models.assert_called_once()
        mock_detect_data_file.assert_called_once_with(self.test_data_dir)
        mock_read_csv.assert_called_once_with('path_to_data_file.csv')
```

### Advanced LSTM Training Test

```python
def test_train_advanced_lstm(self):
    with patch('model_training_main.AdvancedLSTMModelTrainer') as MockAdvancedLSTMTrainer:
        instance = MockAdvancedLSTMTrainer.return_value
        instance.train_lstm.return_value = MagicMock()

        train_advanced_lstm(data_file_path='C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/alpha_vantage/tsla_data.csv')
        instance.train_lstm.assert_called_once()
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Feature Idea:** Consider adding more descriptive error messages in the `train_lstm` method to better identify where issues arise during training.
- **Improvement:** Enhance the test suite to automatically handle file creation and deletion to avoid issues with non-existent files during testing.
- **Reflection:** The current focus on improving test reliability is crucial for ensuring the long-term success of the project. Regular test maintenance and updates are necessary as the codebase evolves.
