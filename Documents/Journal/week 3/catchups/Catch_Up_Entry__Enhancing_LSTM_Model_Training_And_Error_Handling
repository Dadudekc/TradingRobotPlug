---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
- **Objective:** To refine and enhance the LSTM model training process, focusing on resolving errors related to inconsistent input samples and improving the overall robustness of the training pipeline.
- **Goals:** 
  1. Ensure proper alignment between input sequences and target variables.
  2. Integrate enhanced error handling and logging mechanisms.
  3. Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning techniques.

### Actions Taken
- **Updated Sequence Creation:** Introduced the `create_sequences_with_target` function to correctly align input features and target values, resolving mismatches in sequence length.
- **Refined Model Training:** Modified the `train_lstm_model` function to implement better error handling and ensure that input and output shapes are consistent throughout the training process.
- **Enhanced Error Logging:** Added comprehensive logging to capture the shapes of data and provide detailed debug information during model training.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Integrated `optuna` for hyperparameter tuning, which included implementing trial pruning to handle unsuccessful model configurations.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenges:** Encountered issues with inconsistent input sample sizes, which caused the model to fail during training. The primary challenge was ensuring that all sequences and their corresponding targets were correctly aligned.
- **Breakthroughs:** Successfully addressed the input sample inconsistency by updating the sequence creation process, which significantly improved the stability and reliability of the LSTM model training.

### Results and Impact
- **Results:** The enhanced sequence creation and error handling mechanisms led to a smoother and more reliable training process. The integration of `optuna` for hyperparameter tuning enabled efficient optimization of model parameters, leading to improved model performance.
- **Impact:** These improvements contributed to a more robust machine learning pipeline, ensuring that models can be trained with greater accuracy and stability, ultimately enhancing the project's overall progress.

## Code Snippets and Context

### 1. Sequence Creation Function

```python
def create_sequences_with_target(data, target, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    targets = []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        sequences.append(data[i:i + seq_length])
        targets.append(target[i + seq_length])
    return np.array(sequences), np.array(targets)
```
*Context:* This function was introduced to ensure that input sequences and their corresponding target values are correctly aligned, preventing issues during model training.

### 2. Updated `train_lstm_model` Function

```python
def train_lstm_model(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    """Train an LSTM model."""
    logger.info("Training LSTM model...")
    time_steps = 10  # Define the number of time steps for the LSTM input

    X_train_seq, y_train_seq = create_sequences_with_target(X_train, y_train, time_steps)
    X_val_seq, y_val_seq = create_sequences_with_target(X_val, y_val, time_steps)

    logger.debug(f"X_train_seq shape: {X_train_seq.shape}, y_train_seq shape: {y_train_seq.shape}")
    logger.debug(f"X_val_seq shape: {X_val_seq.shape}, y_val_seq shape: {y_val_seq.shape}")

    if X_train_seq.shape[0] != y_train_seq.shape[0] or X_val_seq.shape[0] != y_val_seq.shape[0]:
        raise ValueError(f"Shape mismatch between X and y sequences: X_train_seq {X_train_seq.shape}, y_train_seq {y_train_seq.shape}, X_val_seq {X_val_seq.shape}, y_val_seq {y_val_seq.shape}")

    model_config = LSTMModelConfig.lstm_model(input_shape=(X_train_seq.shape[1], X_train_seq.shape[2]))
    lstm_trainer = LSTMModelTrainer(logger)

    lstm_trainer.train_lstm(X_train_seq, y_train_seq, X_val_seq, y_val_seq, model_config)
    logger.info("LSTM training complete")
```
*Context:* The `train_lstm_model` function was refined to handle errors related to inconsistent input sequences and target variables. This update ensures that all data passed to the model is correctly aligned and processed.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning with `optuna`

```python
def objective(trial):
    model_config = {
        'input_shape': (time_steps, len(selected_features)),
        'layers': [
            {'type': 'bidirectional_lstm', 'units': trial.suggest_int('units_lstm', 50, 200), 'return_sequences': True, 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)},
            {'type': 'attention'},
            {'type': 'batch_norm'},
            {'type': 'dropout', 'rate': trial.suggest_float('dropout_rate', 0.2, 0.5)},
            {'type': 'dense', 'units': trial.suggest_int('units_dense', 10, 50), 'activation': 'relu', 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)}
        ],
        'optimizer': trial.suggest_categorical('optimizer', ['adam', 'sgd', 'rmsprop', 'adadelta']),
        'loss': 'mean_squared_error'
    }
    model = trainer.train_lstm(X_train_scaled, y_train, X_val_scaled, y_val, model_config, epochs=50)
    if model is None:
        raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned()
    y_pred_val = model.predict(X_val_scaled).flatten()
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_val)
    return mse

study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```
*Context:* This snippet illustrates how `optuna` was integrated into the training pipeline to efficiently optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM model. Trial pruning was implemented to skip over unpromising model configurations.
