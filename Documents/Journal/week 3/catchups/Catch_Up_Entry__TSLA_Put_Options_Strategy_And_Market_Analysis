```python
# Example code snippet for calculating key technical indicators in real-time
import numpy as np

def calculate_moving_averages(prices, periods):
    return prices.rolling(window=periods).mean()

def calculate_vwap(prices, volumes):
    return (prices * volumes).cumsum() / volumes.cumsum()

# Implemented these functions in the trading script for real-time analysis
```

## Code Snippets and Context

### Real-Time Moving Average Calculation

```python
# Function to calculate moving averages in real-time for TSLA
def calculate_moving_averages(prices, periods):
    return prices.rolling(window=periods).mean()

# Example usage in trading strategy
short_term_ma = calculate_moving_averages(tsla_prices, 8)  # EMA(8)
long_term_ma = calculate_moving_averages(tsla_prices, 21)  # EMA(21)
```

### VWAP Calculation

```python
# Function to calculate VWAP for better trade entries
def calculate_vwap(prices, volumes):
    return (prices * volumes).cumsum() / volumes.cumsum()

# Example integration
vwap_value = calculate_vwap(tsla_prices, tsla_volumes)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Brainstorming:** Consider developing a dedicated trading bot that uses these technical indicators to automate put option trading strategies.
- **Improvements:** Enhance the current scripts by adding error handling and logging features to better manage unexpected market changes.
- **Reflections:** The session underscored the importance of flexibility in trading strategies and the value of technical analysis in making informed decisions under pressure.
