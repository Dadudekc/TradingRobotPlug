# Catch_Up_Entry__Project_Structure_Alignment_and_Import_Issues_Resolution

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  The primary goal was to streamline and execute the ARIMA model training script across multiple stocks while resolving issues related to import paths and project structure alignment.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Ensured the project structure was correctly aligned to accommodate both relative and absolute imports.
  - Modified the import paths in the `arima_model_trainer.py` script to reflect the correct relative structure, using `sys.path` adjustments for dynamic path management.
  - Debugged and corrected multiple import errors related to the `DataStore` class in the `data_store.py` module.
  - Verified that the `DataStore` class was accessible within the ARIMA model training script by resolving module not found errors.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - The key challenge was handling import errors due to the complex directory structure and ensuring the Python interpreter recognized the correct module paths.
  - A significant breakthrough was achieved by dynamically adjusting `sys.path` based on the script's location, ensuring that all necessary modules were correctly imported.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - Successfully executed the ARIMA model training script, confirming that the `DataStore` class was properly imported and utilized.
  - This progress facilitates the efficient training of ARIMA models for multiple stocks, streamlining the process for future stocks by leveraging the `DataStore` class for data management.

```python
# Adjusted the import path and successfully imported the DataStore class
from Utilities.data_store import DataStore

# Added the 'Utilities' directory to sys.path dynamically
sys.path.append(str(project_root / 'Scripts' / 'Utilities'))

# Successfully used DataStore for loading stock data
df = self.store.load_data(self.symbol)
```

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Essential for debugging, path management, and script execution.
- **Error Handling:** Enhanced skills in identifying and resolving import errors within complex directory structures.
- **Version Control (Git):** Managed code changes and tracked modifications effectively.
- **YAML Configuration:** Utilized YAML for managing configurations and ensuring dynamic loading of settings.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained a deeper understanding of Python's import system, particularly when dealing with complex directory structures.
  - Enhanced skills in dynamically adjusting Python paths to ensure correct module imports.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered unexpected errors related to import paths despite correct relative paths, requiring alternative solutions such as adjusting `sys.path`.
  
- **Future Application:** 
  - Future projects will benefit from improved project structure planning, ensuring that directory structures are conducive to both relative and absolute imports.
  - Plan to integrate similar path management techniques in future multi-module projects to avoid import errors.

---

## To-Do
- **Finalize ARIMA Model Training:** Complete training for all listed stocks as defined in the YAML configuration file.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the current project structure and any changes made to the import paths.
- **Code Refactoring:** Improve the readability and maintainability of the `arima_model_trainer.py` script.
- **Unit Testing:** Develop unit tests for the ARIMA model training process to ensure robustness.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Import Path Adjustment

```python
# Adjust the sys.path for correct module import
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parents[2]
sys.path.append(str(project_root / 'Scripts' / 'Utilities'))

from data_store import DataStore  # Successfully imported DataStore
```

### ARIMA Model Training with DataStore Integration

```python
def load_data(self):
    """Load data for the symbol using DataStore."""
    df = self.store.load_data(self.symbol)
    if df is None or df.empty:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to load data for {self.symbol}")
        raise ValueError(f"No data available for {self.symbol}")
    return df['close']
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Brainstorming:** Consider automating the path adjustments to reduce manual intervention during module imports.
- **Improvements:** Investigate alternative approaches to manage imports in Python, such as creating a central module that handles all imports.
- **Reflection:** The project is now better structured, but itâ€™s important to maintain this structure and ensure all team members understand it to avoid future issues.

## Project Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Corrected import path errors - Completed
- **Milestone 2:** Successfully ran ARIMA model training with proper data handling - Completed
- **Milestone 3:** Documenting the project structure and import management - In Progress

---

## Collaboration and Communication
- **Meetings and Discussions:** Discussed import path issues with the team and agreed on the solution involving dynamic path adjustments.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to keep the project structure as is but ensure paths are correctly managed via `sys.path`.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Document the updated project structure and path management strategy by [specific date].

---

## Risk Management
- **Risk:** Incorrect path adjustments could lead to further import errors.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement unit tests to verify that all modules are correctly imported before deployment.
- **Risk:** Lack of understanding of the new project structure by other team members.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct a brief training session to explain the new structure and import management approach.

---

## Retrospective
- **What Went Well:** The import path issues were resolved efficiently, enabling smooth execution of the ARIMA model training script.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Better initial planning of the project structure could have prevented these issues.
- **Actionable Insights:** Future projects should include a phase dedicated to planning the project structure and import management to avoid such challenges.
