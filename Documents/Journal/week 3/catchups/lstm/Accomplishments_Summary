### Accomplishments_Summary

1. **Integrated Caching Mechanism:**
   - Implemented a caching mechanism using `requests-cache` to reduce API call frequency and improve data retrieval efficiency.

2. **Optimized Data Fetch Script:**
   - Refactored the data fetch script for better maintainability, scalability, and enhanced error handling.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning Completion:**
   - Completed hyperparameter tuning for the LSTM model using `optuna`, identifying optimal parameters and retraining the model for improved performance.

4. **Model Deployment Preparations:**
   - Initiated preparations for model deployment, finalizing Docker setup and creating deployment scripts with necessary dependencies.

5. **Enhanced Model Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Added additional evaluation metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for a more comprehensive performance analysis.
   - Implemented logging for evaluation metrics to track model performance over time.

These accomplishments reflect the progress made across various parts of the project, emphasizing significant milestones and improvements.
