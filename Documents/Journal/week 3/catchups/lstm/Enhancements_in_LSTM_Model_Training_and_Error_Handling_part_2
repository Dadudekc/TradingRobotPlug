## Part 2

### Work Completed

- **Data Augmentation:** Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Added additional metrics for model evaluation to provide a comprehensive performance analysis.
- **Model Deployment:** Initiated the process for model deployment, including containerization using Docker.

---

### Major Code Snippets

#### 1. Data Augmentation Function
```python
def augment_data(data):
    # Augmentation logic here
    return augmented_data
```

#### 2. Enhanced Model Evaluation Function
```python
def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test).flatten()
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)

    logger.info(f"Test MSE: {mse:.2f}, RMSE: {rmse:.2f}, RÂ²: {r2:.2f}, MAE: {mae:.2f}")

    return mse, rmse, r2, mae
```

#### 3. Dockerfile for Model Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
