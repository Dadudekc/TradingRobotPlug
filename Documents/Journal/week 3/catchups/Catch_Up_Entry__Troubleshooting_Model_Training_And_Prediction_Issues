**Catch_Up_Entry__Troubleshooting_Model_Training_And_Prediction_Issues**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - The main objective of this session was to run and validate the training and prediction process of different machine learning models, including ARIMA, LSTM, and neural networks, using existing data and model configurations.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Initiated the ARIMA model training on the AAPL dataset. Encountered and documented issues with model convergence.
  - Loaded and attempted predictions with the LSTM and neural network models on MSFT data, recording detailed logs of input and output discrepancies.
  - Addressed the challenges of loading serialized models and the shape mismatches during model prediction by carefully inspecting error messages and runtime logs.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **ARIMA Model:** Encountered multiple convergence issues during ARIMA model training, which necessitates reevaluating model parameters or preprocessing steps.
  - **LSTM Model:** Faced two critical issues: 
    - The first was related to the model loading process due to serialization errors.
    - The second issue was an input shape mismatch that caused the LSTM model to fail during prediction. 
  - **Neural Network Model:** Successfully loaded the neural network model but ran into an input shape compatibility issue during prediction. This highlighted the need to better align data preprocessing with model expectations.
  
- **Results and Impact:**
  - The ARIMA model training highlighted the need for parameter tuning or an alternative modeling approach due to non-convergence.
  - The LSTM modelâ€™s challenges emphasized the importance of consistent data preprocessing and serialization methods across different environments.
  - Although predictions for the neural network model were not fully successful, the process provided crucial insights into the necessary adjustments for input data handling, which will improve future model training and prediction accuracy.

```python
# Example of ARIMA training initiation
arima_model = ARIMA(train_data, order=(1, 1, 1))
arima_model_fit = arima_model.fit(maxiter=100, disp=False)

# Example of LSTM input data preprocessing
features = preprocess_data(features.values, model_type='lstm')
predictions = lstm_model.predict(features)
```

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Employed for executing scripts, managing model training, and handling data preprocessing tasks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used for loading and running the LSTM and neural network models, dealing with input data shape handling.
- **ARIMA Modeling:** Utilized for time series forecasting with the ARIMA model, though faced challenges with parameter settings.
- **Debugging:** Applied extensive debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues with model convergence and input data mismatches.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the importance of ensuring that the input data's shape matches the expected format for different model types, particularly in LSTM and neural networks.
  - Learned that ARIMA models require careful parameter tuning, especially when dealing with non-stationary data.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered serialization errors when loading models, which underscored the need for consistency in model saving and loading processes.
  - The shape mismatch error in LSTM highlighted that more rigorous checks are necessary during data preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the model architecture.

- **Future Application:**
  - Plan to implement more robust data validation checks before model training and prediction processes to avoid input shape issues.
  - Will explore alternative time series models or better preprocessing techniques to address ARIMA convergence challenges.

## To-Do

- **Adjust ARIMA Parameters:** Revisit and adjust the parameters for the ARIMA model to improve convergence during training.
- **Fix LSTM Loading Issues:** Investigate and resolve the serialization problem when loading the LSTM model, possibly by re-saving the model with a different protocol.
- **Address Input Shape Mismatches:** Refactor the data preprocessing steps to ensure that input data is correctly shaped for each model type, particularly for LSTM and neural networks.
- **Run Additional Tests:** Conduct further tests on the neural network model with adjusted input data to ensure that predictions can be generated successfully.

## Code Snippets and Context

### ARIMA Model Training Initialization

```python
# ARIMA Model initialization and training with sample data
arima_model = ARIMA(train_data, order=(1, 1, 1))
arima_model_fit = arima_model.fit(maxiter=100, disp=False)
```

### LSTM Model Data Preprocessing

```python
# Preprocessing input features for LSTM model
features = preprocess_data(features.values, model_type='lstm')

# LSTM model prediction
predictions = lstm_model.predict(features)
```

### Neural Network Model Loading and Prediction
