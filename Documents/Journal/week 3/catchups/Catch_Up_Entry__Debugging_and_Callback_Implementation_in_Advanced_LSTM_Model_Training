# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_and_Callback_Implementation_in_Advanced_LSTM_Model_Training**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
- The main objective was to resolve errors encountered during the training of the Advanced LSTM model. Specifically, issues related to multiple values being passed for the `epochs` argument and the correct implementation of Keras callbacks.

### Actions Taken:
1. **Error Resolution**: Identified and resolved a `TypeError` where the `train_lstm` method received multiple values for the `epochs` argument. The issue was due to passing `epochs` both as a positional and keyword argument.
2. **Callback Implementation**: Implemented `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` callbacks in the `train_lstm` method to enhance the training process by stopping early when no improvement is observed and reducing the learning rate when needed.
3. **Code Refactoring**: Moved the callback definitions and method calls inside the `main()` function to ensure they are correctly initialized and used within the training process.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: Conducted multiple test runs to confirm that the Advanced LSTM model could train successfully without encountering the previous errors.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge**: The initial issue with the `TypeError` was challenging due to the multiple sources where `epochs` could be passed incorrectly.
- **Breakthrough**: Successfully refactored the code to eliminate the error, enabling smooth execution of the model training. Additionally, the implementation of callbacks improved the model's training performance by preventing overfitting and unnecessary training epochs.

### Results and Impact:
- The Advanced LSTM model training is now functioning correctly, with the Keras callbacks enhancing the model's performance and efficiency. This progress contributes significantly to the overall project by ensuring that the model can be trained effectively, leading to better predictions in the trading robot.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming**: Refactoring and debugging of the Advanced LSTM model training script.
- **Keras and TensorFlow**: Implementation of Keras callbacks (`EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`) to improve model training.
- **Debugging**: Utilized effective debugging techniques to identify and resolve the error related to multiple values being passed for the `epochs` argument.
- **Project Structure Management**: Adjusted Python path and project structure to ensure smooth execution and testing.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gained deeper insight into the importance of managing argument passing in functions and methods, particularly in complex models with multiple configurations.
- **Unexpected Challenges**: The error with multiple values for `epochs` was unexpected, requiring a careful review of the method call to resolve.
- **Future Application**: The lessons learned from handling arguments and implementing callbacks will be applied to future model training scripts, ensuring better code structure and robustness in training configurations.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete Testing**: Continue testing the Advanced LSTM model under various configurations to ensure robustness.
- **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect recent changes and the implementation of callbacks.
- **Code Review**: Conduct a code review session to ensure that the refactoring meets project standards.
- **Feature Implementation**: Begin working on integrating additional features like real-time data processing in the LSTM model.

    logger_handler = LoggerHandler()

    # Load and preprocess data
    data_loader = DataLoader(logger_handler)
