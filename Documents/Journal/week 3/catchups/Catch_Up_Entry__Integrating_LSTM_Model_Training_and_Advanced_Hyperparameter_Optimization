## Work Completed

**Objectives and Goals:**
The primary objective was to enhance the LSTM model training process by integrating advanced hyperparameter optimization and improving data preprocessing techniques. This included refining the model configuration, implementing sequence creation, and evaluating model performance.

**Actions Taken:**
1. **Data Handling:**
   - Implemented a robust data loading function to handle CSV files and preprocess the data by removing non-numeric values and filling NaNs with median values.
   - Added logging to track the success or failure of data loading operations.

2. **Model Configuration and Training:**
   - Defined and refined the `LSTMModelConfig` class to support flexible model architecture through dynamic layer definitions.
   - Created an LSTM model trainer (`LSTMModelTrainer`) to handle preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the model.
   - Implemented sequence creation for time series data to prepare the data for LSTM training.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Integrated Optuna for hyperparameter optimization to find the best model configuration. This included defining an objective function and optimizing hyperparameters such as the number of units in LSTM layers, dropout rates, and optimizers.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Added functionality to evaluate the trained model's performance on test data, including metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².

5. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Enhanced logging to capture detailed information about the model training process, including data shapes and training metrics.

**Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
- **Challenge:** Encountered difficulties with sequence creation due to incorrect indexing.
  - **Resolution:** Corrected indexing in the `create_sequences` method to ensure proper alignment of features and target values.
- **Breakthrough:** Successfully integrated Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, which significantly improved the model's performance and training efficiency.

**Results and Impact:**
- Improved the model's accuracy and training process through advanced hyperparameter optimization.
- Enhanced data preprocessing and logging practices, leading to more reliable and traceable model training.

**Code Snippets and Context:**

### Data Handling and Preprocessing

```python
def load_data(file_path):
    """Load data from a CSV file."""
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv(file_path, parse_dates=['date'])
        logger.info(f"Data loaded successfully from {file_path}")
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to load data from {file_path}: {e}")
        return None

def preprocess_data(data):
    """Preprocess the data by handling non-numeric values and filling NaNs."""
    numeric_data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    data_cleaned = numeric_data.fillna(numeric_data.median())
    return data_cleaned
```

### LSTM Model Configuration and Training

```python
class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, model_params):
        model = Sequential()
        for layer in model_params['layers']:
            if layer['type'] == 'bidirectional_lstm':
                model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer['return_sequences'], kernel_regularizer=layer['kernel_regularizer']),
                                        input_shape=input_shape))
            elif layer['type'] == 'batch_norm':
                model.add(BatchNormalization())
            elif layer['type'] == 'dropout':
                model.add(Dropout(rate=layer['rate']))
            elif layer['type'] == 'dense':
                model.add(Dense(units=layer['units'], activation=layer['activation'], kernel_regularizer=layer['kernel_regularizer']))
        model.compile(optimizer=model_params['optimizer'], loss=model_params['loss'])
        return model

class LSTMModelTrainer:
    def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
        xs, ys = [], []
        for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
            x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
            y = target[i + time_steps]
            xs.append(x)
            ys.append(y)
        return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

    model = self.train_lstm(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, LSTMModelConfig.lstm_model((X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), model_config), epochs=50)
    
    if model is None:
        raise optuna.exceptions.TrialPruned()
    
    y_pred_val = model.predict(X_val).flatten()
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_val)
