# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Errors_In_LSTM_Model_Training_And_Logging_Implementation**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
The primary objective for this session was to debug and resolve errors encountered during the training of an LSTM model within the project. The goals included ensuring that all necessary imports were correctly set up, resolving attribute errors related to method definitions, and verifying the correct functioning of the logging system.

### Actions Taken
- **Resolved Import Issues:** Identified and fixed missing imports, particularly for the `RobustScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
- **Defined `build_lstm_model` Method:** Added the `build_lstm_model` method within the `AdvancedLSTMModelTrainer` class to ensure the model architecture is correctly defined and returned during training.
- **Fixed Logging Implementation:** Adjusted the logging calls to use the `LoggerHandler`'s `log` method instead of directly calling methods like `info`, ensuring compatibility with the custom logging class.
- **Debugging and Error Handling:** Addressed several errors including `NameError` for undefined imports and `AttributeError` for missing method definitions, ensuring that the script could run without interruptions.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenges:**
  - Encountered multiple errors related to undefined imports and missing method definitions which required a careful review of the code structure.
- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Successfully implemented and integrated the `build_lstm_model` method, resolving the `AttributeError`.
  - Improved the logging system to provide more detailed insights during the model training process.

### Results and Impact
The efforts during this session led to a more robust and error-free implementation of the LSTM model training pipeline. The correct functioning of the logging system will allow for better tracking and debugging in future runs. This progress is crucial for the overall project, as it enhances the reliability and maintainability of the code.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting the LSTM model training and debugging.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Employed to define and train the LSTM model.
- **Logging:** Implemented a custom logging solution using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module.
- **Error Handling:** Applied systematic debugging techniques to resolve code issues.
- **Version Control (Git):** Used for tracking changes and ensuring code consistency.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Importance of Method Definitions:** Ensured that all required methods are defined within the class, particularly when calling them within other methods, to avoid `AttributeError`.
- **Logging Best Practices:** Reinforced the need to use a consistent logging method across the project for better traceability.
- **Debugging Strategy:** Recognized the value of systematically addressing import and method-related errors to prevent cascading issues.

### Unexpected Challenges
- Encountered unexpected issues with undefined methods and imports that required additional debugging time.

### Future Application
- Going forward, I will ensure to verify that all necessary methods are defined before running complex scripts and implement comprehensive unit tests to catch such issues early.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for the `AdvancedLSTMModelTrainer` class to verify the correctness of all methods.
- **Enhance Model Evaluation:** Extend the evaluation metrics and logging to include additional performance metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect the changes made to the LSTM model training script.
- **Optimize Hyperparameters:** Run the `optimize_hyperparameters` method with additional trials to fine-tune the LSTM model.

## Code Snippets and Context

### LSTM Model Builder

```python
def build_lstm_model(self, input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(units=100, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
    model.add(Dense(units=1))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model
```

**Context:** This method constructs and compiles an LSTM model with two LSTM layers and a dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

### Logging Implementation

```python
self.logger.log("Starting LSTM model training...", level="INFO")
```

**Context:** The `log` method of the `LoggerHandler` is used to track the beginning of the LSTM model training process. This ensures consistent logging practices throughout the project.

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Improvement:** Consider integrating a more advanced logging framework that allows for different logging levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `ERROR`) to be easily toggled based on the environment (development vs production).
- **Reflection:** The session highlighted the importance of methodical error handling and the need to address each issue systematically. Regular code reviews could help catch such issues earlier in the development process.
