# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_Model_Training_For_LSTM_And_Neural_Networks**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The main goal was to resolve errors in the LSTM and Neural Network model training scripts, ensuring they function correctly during execution.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - **LSTM Model Debugging:** Identified and corrected the `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` error by refining how the model parameters were accessed and utilized within the LSTM model configuration.
  - **Neural Network Model Adjustments:** Resolved issues related to incorrect epoch handling and improper configuration in the Neural Network trainer, ensuring it runs without errors.
  - **Script Testing and Validation:** Repeatedly tested the entire model training script to confirm that the fixes were effective and that no new errors were introduced.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** The specific error `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` was difficult to trace, requiring a detailed review of the TensorFlow model architecture and how parameters were being handled.
  - **Breakthrough:** The breakthrough occurred when the issue was traced back to incorrect handling of layer parameters within the LSTM model configuration, which was then rectified to allow successful model training.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The LSTM and Neural Network models were successfully trained without errors, allowing the project to progress towards hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. The corrections significantly improved the reliability and stability of the model training pipeline.

```python
class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, params):
        inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
        x = inputs

        for layer in params['layers']:
            if layer['type'] == 'lstm':
                x = LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer.get('return_sequences', False), kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None))(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'bidirectional_lstm':
                x = Bidirectional(LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer.get('return_sequences', False), kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None)))(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'batch_norm':
                x = BatchNormalization()(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'dropout':
                x = Dropout(rate=layer['rate'])(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'attention':
                x = Attention()([x, x])
            elif layer['type'] == 'dense':
                x = Dense(units=layer['units'], activation=layer['activation'], kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None))(x)

        outputs = Dense(1)(x)
        model = Model(inputs, outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer=params['optimizer'], loss=params['loss'])
        
        return model
```

    lstm_trainer = LSTMModelTrainer(logger)
    
    lstm_params = {
        'layers': [
            {'type': 'bidirectional_lstm', 'units': 100, 'return_sequences': True, 'kernel_regularizer': l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)},

        ],
        'optimizer': 'adam',
        'loss': 'mean_squared_error'
    }

    model_config = LSTMModelConfig.lstm_model(input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), params=lstm_params)
    lstm_trainer.train_lstm(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, model_config, epochs=50)
