**Catch_Up_Entry__Model_Training__ARIMA_Implementation__and_Unit_Testing"**

## Work Completed
### Objectives and Goals:
- The main objective of this session was to enhance the model training process within the project by implementing and testing both ARIMA and neural network models. Additionally, unit tests were to be added to ensure the reliability and accuracy of these models.

### Actions Taken:
- **ARIMA Model Implementation:** Developed the `ARIMAModelTrainer` class, which automates ARIMA model training on stock price data. This involved loading data, scaling features, identifying optimal ARIMA parameters, and performing predictions.
- **Neural Network Training Framework:** Created the `NeuralNetworkTrainer` class to facilitate the building and training of dense and LSTM-based neural networks. The class was designed with flexibility, allowing for easy configuration and integration of pretrained models.
- **Unit Test Development:** Added unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of the ARIMA model trainer and the neural network trainer. The tests were structured to verify model initialization, training processes, and output generation.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Implemented logging within both models to capture key events and errors during training, aiding in debugging and providing a detailed training log.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge:** Handling missing or incomplete data during ARIMA model training led to issues, particularly with the `symbol` column in the dataset, which had missing values.
- **Breakthrough:** The introduction of error handling mechanisms within the `ARIMAModelTrainer` allowed for the graceful management of these issues, ensuring the model continued training without crashing.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring that the neural network training process was adaptable to different model configurations (dense vs. LSTM) while maintaining efficient resource use across multiple GPUs.
- **Breakthrough:** The use of TensorFlow’s `MirroredStrategy` effectively distributed the workload across GPUs, allowing for smoother training processes even with large datasets.

### Results and Impact:
- **ARIMA Model Performance:** The ARIMA model demonstrated stable performance, producing reasonable predictions, though some room for parameter tuning remains. The results were saved for further analysis and comparison with neural network outputs.
- **Neural Network Flexibility:** The neural network trainer proved versatile, successfully handling both dense and LSTM architectures. This flexibility will allow for broader experimentation with model types in future work.
- **Unit Test Validation:** The unit tests confirmed the robustness of the training processes, ensuring that both ARIMA and neural network models are functioning as intended. This added layer of validation is crucial as the project scales.

```python
# Example from NeuralNetworkTrainer class
def scheduler(self, epoch, lr):
    if epoch < 10:
        return lr
    else:
        return float(lr * tf.math.exp(-0.1))

# Example from ARIMAModelTrainer class
def background_training(self):
    try:
        model = pm.auto_arima(history, start_p=1, start_q=1, max_p=3, max_q=3, seasonal=False, maxiter=1000)
        model_fit = pm.ARIMA(order=model.order, maxiter=1000).fit(history)
        self.display_message(f"Selected ARIMA parameters: {model.order}", "INFO")
    except Exception as e:
        self.display_message(f"Error finding ARIMA parameters: {e}", "ERROR")
```
