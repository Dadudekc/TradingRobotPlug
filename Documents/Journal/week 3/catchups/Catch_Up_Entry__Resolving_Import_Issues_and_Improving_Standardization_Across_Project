**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Import_Issues_and_Improving_Standardization_Across_Project**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  The main objective was to resolve import issues that were causing the Python scripts in the project to fail due to module path problems. Additionally, I aimed to standardize the way paths, logging, and other configurations were handled across various scripts within the project to ensure consistency and maintainability.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated the `linear_regression.py` and `neural_network.py` scripts to dynamically determine the project root and adjust the Python path accordingly. This ensures that the scripts can correctly locate and import modules from the `Scripts.Utilities` package.
  - Implemented a consistent logging setup across the scripts to ensure all logs are saved to a designated `logs` directory. This included setting up loggers using the `LoggerHandler` class from `model_training_utils.py`.
  - Modified the data preprocessing and model training processes in `neural_network.py` to handle non-numeric columns correctly, addressing issues where string values (like 'tsla') were causing failures during scaling.
  - Utilized the `DataLoader` and `DataPreprocessor` classes from `model_training_utils.py` for consistent data loading and preprocessing across different scripts.
  - Ran tests and debugging sessions to verify that the changes were effective in resolving the import issues and ensuring consistent behavior across the project.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenges:** 
    - Initially, the scripts failed to locate the `Scripts.Utilities` module, resulting in `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions. This required careful restructuring of the Python path configuration.
    - Handling non-numeric columns during data preprocessing was another challenge, as it caused crashes during the scaling process. This required adjusting the preprocessing logic to remove or transform non-numeric columns.
  - **Breakthroughs:**
    - Successfully resolved the import issues by dynamically adjusting the Python path based on the script's location relative to the project root. This approach proved effective across different scripts.
    - Implemented a uniform logging configuration across scripts, improving traceability and consistency in logging outputs.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The import issues have been fully resolved, allowing all scripts to run without errors. This has improved the stability and reliability of the project.
  - The standardization of logging and path handling has enhanced maintainability and reduced the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future.
  - The preprocessing improvements have ensured that the neural network model can handle various data types without encountering errors, leading to smoother model training sessions.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used extensively for scripting, module handling, and debugging.
- **Logging:** Implemented consistent logging across the project to enhance debugging and traceability.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Applied data preprocessing techniques using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, including handling non-numeric data and scaling features.
- **TensorFlow:** Utilized for building and training neural network models with distributed strategies.
- **SHAP:** Used for model explainability, particularly for generating SHAP values to understand model predictions.
- **Version Control (Git):** Used for tracking changes and ensuring that all modifications were appropriately versioned.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of Pythonâ€™s module import system and how to dynamically adjust the Python path to avoid import errors.
  - Learned the importance of standardizing logging and configuration across a project to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.
  - Improved my ability to handle and preprocess data, particularly in managing non-numeric columns that can disrupt scaling operations.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered unexpected issues with non-numeric data in the dataset, which required additional preprocessing steps that were not initially anticipated.
  - The process of ensuring uniformity across different scripts revealed inconsistencies that needed to be addressed, such as different logging setups and path configurations.

- **Future Application:**
  - These lessons will influence future projects by emphasizing the need for standardized configurations and logging from the outset. This will streamline development and reduce the potential for errors.
  - The experience with handling non-numeric data will guide future data preprocessing efforts, ensuring that all potential data types are considered and appropriately managed.

## To-Do

- **Complete Unit Tests:** Finalize unit tests for all scripts that were modified to ensure they function as expected.
- **Refactor Code:** Review and refactor other scripts in the project to apply the same standardization for logging and path handling.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the changes made to the Python path configuration and logging setup.
- **Model Training:** Continue testing the neural network model with different datasets to ensure robustness and accuracy.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Dynamic Path Setup and Logging Configuration

```python
import os
import sys
import logging

# Dynamically set the project root and adjust the Python path
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir, os.pardir))
sys.path.append(project_root)

# Setup logging
logger_handler = LoggerHandler()
logger = logger_handler.logger

# Example log message
logger.info("Script started successfully.")
```

### Preprocessing Non-Numeric Data

```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self, logger_handler, config_manager):
        self.logger = logger_handler
        self.config_manager = config_manager

    def preprocess_data(self, data, target_column='close', date_column='date', scaler_type='StandardScaler'):
        # Handle date columns and create lag features
        data = self._handle_dates(data, date_column)
        data = self._create_lag_features(data, target_column)

        # Remove non-numeric columns
        X = data.drop(columns=[target_column])
        X = X.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

        y = data[target_column]
        return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Brainstorming:** Consider implementing a more advanced configuration management system that can handle different environments (development, testing, production) with specific settings for each.
- **Improvements:** Improve the error handling in data preprocessing to provide more informative error messages when unexpected data types are encountered.
- **Reflection:** The project is moving in the right direction with the resolution of critical issues. Ensuring uniformity across all scripts has made the codebase more cohesive and maintainable.
