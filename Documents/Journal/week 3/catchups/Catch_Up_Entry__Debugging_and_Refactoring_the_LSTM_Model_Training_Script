# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_and_Refactoring_the_LSTM_Model_Training_Script**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** The primary objective was to debug and refine the LSTM model training script (`lstm.py`) to ensure proper execution and resolve any errors encountered during runtime.
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Started by running the LSTM model script and encountered a series of errors related to function arguments, incorrect usage of data types, and improper sequence creation.
  - Corrected the `create_sequences` method in the `AdvancedLSTMModelTrainer` class by replacing pandas `.iloc` with numpy indexing to properly handle numpy arrays.
  - Refactored the method call to the `basicLSTMModelConfig.lstm_model()` to pass only the required `input_shape` argument, resolving a `TypeError`.
  - Ensured that `epochs` was passed correctly to avoid duplication, thereby eliminating the `TypeError: train_lstm() got multiple values for argument 'epochs'`.
  - Reviewed and adjusted logging and data preprocessing steps for better clarity and debugging.
- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenge:** The initial code had issues with data handling, particularly in how sequences were generated and how arguments were passed to functions. 
  - **Breakthrough:** Successfully refactoring the `create_sequences` method and correcting the function arguments resolved the major issues, allowing the script to run smoothly.
- **Results and Impact:** The LSTM model training script was debugged and refactored, resulting in successful execution without errors. This progress ensures that the model can now be trained and validated, moving the project forward significantly.

```python
# Corrected create_sequences method
@staticmethod
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
        y = target[i + time_steps]  # Use numpy indexing instead of .iloc
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Extensive debugging and refactoring of the LSTM model training script.
- **TensorFlow:** Utilized for building and training the LSTM model.
- **Numpy and Pandas:** Data manipulation and sequence generation for model training.
- **Logging:** Enhanced logging to track script execution and aid in debugging.
- **Error Handling:** Addressed and resolved multiple runtime errors and improved overall script robustness.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** Gained deeper insights into handling numpy arrays vs. pandas DataFrames in machine learning pipelines, particularly in sequence-based models like LSTMs.
- **Unexpected Challenges:** Encountered unexpected issues with argument handling and sequence generation, which required a thorough review of the code to identify and fix.
- **Future Application:** Future work will benefit from the lessons learned in argument handling and data preprocessing, especially when working with complex machine learning models. Improved code review processes will also be applied to catch such issues earlier in the development process.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete Model Training:** Finalize the LSTM model training and evaluate its performance.
- **Refactor Data Preprocessing:** Review and potentially optimize the data preprocessing pipeline for efficiency.
- **Enhance Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect recent changes and improvements.
- **Code Review:** Conduct a comprehensive code review to ensure all changes are robust and maintainable.

## Code Snippets and Context

### LSTM Model Training Script

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\ModelTraining\model_training\models\lstm.py

import sys
from pathlib import Path
import logging
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Function to create sequences for LSTM training
@staticmethod
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
        y = target[i + time_steps]
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)

# Example usage of LSTM model configuration and training
model_config = basicLSTMModelConfig.lstm_model(input_shape=(X_train_seq.shape[1], X_train_seq.shape[2]))
trainer.train_lstm(X_train_seq, y_train_seq, X_val_seq, y_val_seq, model_config, epochs=50)
```
