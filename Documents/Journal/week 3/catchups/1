# Project Journal Entry

**Catch Up Entry: "Addressing_Log_File_Creation_Issue_and_Enhancing_Error_Handling_in_ARIMA_Model_Trainer"**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** The primary objective was to resolve a `FileNotFoundError` that occurred during the logging setup within the `ARIMAModelTrainer` class, due to the absence of the directory where the log file was intended to be saved. An additional goal was to ensure that the project's root path and directory structures were correctly identified and handled to prevent future issues.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Enhanced the `setup_logger` function to check for the existence of the log directory and create it if necessary.
  - Verified the project's root path and ensured that the `Utilities` directory was correctly added to `sys.path`.
  - Updated the `setup_logger` function in `test2.py` to prevent the `FileNotFoundError` by dynamically creating required directories, ensuring that logging could proceed without interruptions.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** The critical challenge was a `FileNotFoundError` that interrupted the execution of the `ARIMAModelTrainer` due to the missing directory for the log file.
  - **Breakthrough:** Implementing a mechanism to dynamically create the directory if it was missing successfully resolved the issue, enabling smooth logging and uninterrupted script execution.

- **Results and Impact:** The implemented solution eliminated the `FileNotFoundError` and ensured that the logging mechanism worked as intended. This not only improved the reliability of the ARIMA model training process but also strengthened the overall stability of the project by preventing similar issues in the future.

```python
import os
import logging

def setup_logger(name, log_file, level=logging.DEBUG):
    # Ensure the directory for the log file exists
    log_dir = os.path.dirname(log_file)
    if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
        os.makedirs(log_dir)  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist

    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level)

    fh = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
    fh.setLevel(level)

    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)

    logger.addHandler(fh)
    
    return logger
```

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Applied for scripting, error handling, and enhancing the logging setup.
- **Error Handling:** Improved error management by ensuring necessary directories are created to prevent runtime errors.
- **Logging:** Enhanced the project's logging capabilities by implementing reliable log file creation and management.
- **Project Management:** Maintained project structure integrity by ensuring correct path handling and directory management.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** Learned the importance of verifying the existence of directories before performing file operations to prevent runtime errors that could disrupt the script's functionality.
- **Unexpected Challenges:** Encountered an unexpected need to handle directory creation within the logging setup, which was successfully addressed with the implemented solution.
- **Future Application:** This approach will be applied to other parts of the project, where similar error handling practices will be implemented to enhance overall robustness and stability.

---

## To-Do

- **Complete Unit Tests:** Ensure that the unit tests cover the new logging setup to verify that directory creation and logging function correctly in various scenarios.
- **Refactor Code:** Extend the directory existence checks across other project scripts to prevent related issues in different parts of the codebase.
- **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to reflect the changes made in the logging setup and directory management.
- **Feature Implementation:** Consider additional improvements to the ARIMA model training process, such as detailed logging of model performance metrics.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Enhanced Logging Setup with Directory Creation

```python
import os
import logging

def setup_logger(name, log_file, level=logging.DEBUG):
    log_dir = os.path.dirname(log_file)
    if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
        os.makedirs(log_dir)  # Ensure the directory exists

    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level)

    fh = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
    fh.setLevel(level)

    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)

    logger.addHandler(fh)
    
    return logger
```

### ARIMA Model Trainer Initialization

```python
class ARIMAModelTrainer:
    def __init__(self, symbol, threshold=100):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.store = DataStore()
        project_root = get_project_root()
        log_file = project_root / f'logs/arima_{symbol}.log'
        self.logger = setup_logger(f'ARIMA_{self.symbol}', log_file)
        self.close_prices = self.load_data()
```
