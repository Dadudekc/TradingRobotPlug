Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_Neural_Network_Model_Training_and_Integrating_Basic_LSTM

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** The primary objectives were to debug and resolve issues related to the `NeuralNetworkTrainer` class, specifically regarding the unexpected `epochs` argument, and to integrate a basic LSTM model into the existing model training script.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified the root cause of the `TypeError` in the `NeuralNetworkTrainer.train()` method by removing the incorrectly passed `epochs` argument from the method call. The `epochs` parameter was instead set during the initialization of the `NeuralNetworkTrainer` class.
  - Updated the `train_neural_network` function to correctly utilize the `NeuralNetworkTrainer` class without passing unnecessary parameters.
  - Integrated a new `basicLSTMModelTrainer` and `basicLSTMModelConfig` into the existing model training script to offer an additional model training option.
  - Ensured that the model configuration, training processes, and callbacks were properly aligned to support both dense neural networks and LSTM-based models.
  - Tested the updated script to ensure that all model types, including the basic LSTM, were functioning correctly without runtime errors.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** The initial challenge involved debugging the `TypeError` related to the unexpected `epochs` argument in the `train_neural_network` function.
  - **Breakthrough:** The issue was resolved by correctly initializing the `NeuralNetworkTrainer` with the `epochs` parameter and removing it from the method call, resulting in successful model training execution.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The successful resolution of the `TypeError` allowed the neural network model to be trained without errors, improving the overall robustness of the model training pipeline.
  - The integration of the basic LSTM model added versatility to the model training script, allowing users to choose from a broader range of model architectures, thus enhancing the script's functionality and adaptability.

```python
# Corrected train_neural_network Function
def train_neural_network(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    """Train a Neural Network model."""
    logger.info("Training Neural Network model...")
    model_config = NNModelConfig.dense_model()
    nn_trainer = NeuralNetworkTrainer(model_config, epochs=50)
    nn_trainer.train(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)  # No epochs parameter here
    logger.info("Neural Network training complete")
```
