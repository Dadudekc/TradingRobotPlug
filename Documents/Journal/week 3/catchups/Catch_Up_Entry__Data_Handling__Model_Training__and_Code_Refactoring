### Project Journal Entry: Catch Up Entry: Data Handling, Model Training, and Code Refactoring

### Date: July 22, 2024

---

### Work Completed:

1. **File Path Error Resolution:**
   - Corrected the file path for the data file (`C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\data\alpha_vantage\tsla_data.csv`).
   - Added functionality to browse for the data file using `tkinter`, with the default directory set to `C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\data\alpha_vantage`.

2. **Integration of ARIMA Model Training:**
   - Wrapped the ARIMA model training code into a class named `ARIMAModelTrainer`.
   - Integrated `ARIMAModelTrainer` into the `ModelTraining` class to streamline the training process.
   - Added functionality to save ARIMA model predictions to a CSV file.

3. **Code Refactoring:**
   - Improved the structure of the main script to enable dynamic file selection.
   - Ensured proper error handling and logging throughout the process for better maintainability.

4. **Data Preprocessing Enhancements:**
   - Enhanced the data preprocessing script to efficiently handle NaN values and perform feature engineering.
   - Modified the `DataPreprocessing` class to seamlessly integrate with the ARIMA model.

5. **ARIMA Model Training Process:**
   - Successfully executed the ARIMA model training with the following steps:
     - Completed training steps from 558/566 to 565/566.
     - Recorded final performance metrics: Test MSE = 97042.73.
     - Saved results to `arima_predictions.csv`.
     - Logged information on the completion of the training process, including recommendations for improving forecasting accuracy.

6. **Code Modularization and Execution:**
   - Modularized the code into separate files for better readability and maintainability:
     - `data_preprocessing.py`
     - `model_training.py`
     - `main.py`
   - Ran the modularized code successfully, achieving the following outcomes:
     - Efficient handling of data preprocessing steps.
     - Successful LSTM model training with 50 epochs.
     - Recorded final validation metrics for LSTM: MSE = 15469.76, RMSE = 124.38, RÂ² = 0.81.
     - Saved the model at `models/LSTM_20240722_070936.pkl`.
