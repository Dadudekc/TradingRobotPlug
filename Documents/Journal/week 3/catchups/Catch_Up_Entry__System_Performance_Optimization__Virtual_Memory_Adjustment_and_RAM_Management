## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
The primary objective of this session was to address the slowdown in system performance by optimizing virtual memory settings based on the installed RAM. The goal was to increase virtual memory to enhance overall system responsiveness, particularly when handling multiple tasks or large datasets.

### Actions Taken:
- **RAM Identification:** Determined the installed RAM on the system using various methods, such as System Information and Task Manager, confirming the system had 12 GB of RAM.
- **Virtual Memory Adjustment:** Increased the virtual memory (paging file) size to an optimized value. The Initial size was set to 12288 MB (equivalent to 12 GB), and the Maximum size was set to 24576 MB (24 GB) to improve performance.
- **System Restart:** Restarted the computer to apply the new virtual memory settings.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge:** Identifying the appropriate virtual memory settings for a system with 12 GB of RAM without causing potential performance issues.
- **Breakthrough:** Successfully applied the recommended virtual memory settings based on best practices, leading to noticeable improvements in system performance.

### Results and Impact:
- **Results:** The system's responsiveness improved, especially when running multiple applications simultaneously. The optimized virtual memory settings allowed for better management of memory-intensive tasks, reducing the likelihood of system slowdowns.
- **Impact:** The changes positively impacted the project workflow, allowing for smoother development and testing processes without the hindrance of performance bottlenecks.
