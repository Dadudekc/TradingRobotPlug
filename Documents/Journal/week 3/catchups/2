**Catch Up Entry: "Developing a Bearish Options Strategy for TSLA Based on Technical Analysis"**

---

## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals:
- Develop a detailed trading plan for taking a bearish position on TSLA using options, with the goal of achieving a $1,000 profit based on technical analysis indicators, particularly the MACD.

### Actions Taken:
- **Technical Analysis**: Analyzed the provided screenshots of TSLA's stock chart to identify key resistance and support levels, focusing on indicators like the MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI.
- **Strategy Development**: Formulated a plan to use naked puts, selecting appropriate strike prices and expiration dates, considering the current market conditions and technical indicators.
- **Risk Management**: Calculated the potential risks associated with the trade, ensuring the trade aligns with the user's $6,000 account balance and risk tolerance.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenge**: Balancing the risk of a naked put strategy with the desired profit target, especially given the volatile nature of TSLA.
- **Breakthrough**: Identified a realistic approach to achieve the $1,000 profit target by carefully selecting strike prices and managing position sizes, while ensuring that the risk is kept within acceptable limits.

### Results and Impact:
- **Outcome**: Created a well-structured trading plan tailored to the user's objectives, allowing for a clear path to achieving the desired profit. This plan provides a solid framework for making informed decisions throughout the trading day.
- **Impact**: The strategy enhances the user's ability to execute a disciplined trading approach, focusing on technical analysis and risk management to achieve specific financial goals.
