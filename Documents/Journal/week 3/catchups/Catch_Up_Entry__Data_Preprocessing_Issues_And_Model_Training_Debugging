## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The primary objective was to train an LSTM model on TSLA stock data and address errors encountered during the ARIMA model training process. 
  - Identify and resolve issues related to data preprocessing, particularly handling `NaN` values and ensuring correct input shapes for the LSTM model.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Investigated and resolved multiple errors encountered during the ARIMA and LSTM model training processes.
  - Implemented checks and handling mechanisms for `NaN` values in the input data to prevent training interruptions.
  - Addressed issues related to incorrect input shapes for the LSTM model by ensuring proper data reshaping.
  - Refactored logging statements to avoid syntax errors and improved error handling during model training.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenges:** 
    - Encountered `NaN` values in the training data, leading to errors during the LSTM model training.
    - Faced issues with incorrect input shapes for the LSTM model, causing the model to throw errors during the training process.
    - Debugging the `Logger.log()` method, which was incorrectly used, leading to errors during logging.
  - **Breakthroughs:** 
    - Successfully implemented data preprocessing steps to handle `NaN` values, allowing the model to train without interruptions.
    - Corrected input shape errors for the LSTM model, ensuring compatibility with the expected model architecture.
    - Refactored logging calls to use the correct syntax, improving error handling and debugging capabilities.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The code was refactored to better handle edge cases, particularly related to `NaN` values and input shape mismatches. 
  - The improvements made will significantly enhance the reliability and robustness of the model training process, enabling smoother and more accurate training sessions.

```python
# Handling NaN values in LSTM model training
if np.isnan(X_train_reshaped).any() or np.isnan(X_val_reshaped).any() or np.isnan(y_train).any() or np.isnan(y_val).any():
    self.logger.log(level=logging.WARNING, msg="NaN values detected in the input data. Filling NaNs with column means.")
    X_train_reshaped = np.nan_to_num(X_train_reshaped, nan=np.nanmean(X_train_reshaped))
    X_val_reshaped = np.nan_to_num(X_val_reshaped, nan=np.nanmean(X_val_reshaped))
    y_train = np.nan_to_num(y_train, nan=np.nanmean(y_train))
    y_val = np.nan_to_num(y_val, nan=np.nanmean(y_val))
```

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Utilized for debugging, data preprocessing, and model training script adjustments.
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Used for training the LSTM model, requiring in-depth understanding of input shapes and data formatting.
- **Sklearn Preprocessing:** Employed to handle data scaling and managing `NaN` values in the dataset.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Refined logging practices to better trace errors and monitor model training progress.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - The importance of thorough data preprocessing, especially when dealing with time series data that may contain missing or malformed entries.
  - Recognized the need for correctly handling input shapes in deep learning models to avoid compatibility issues.
  - Learned the value of clear and concise logging practices to aid in debugging complex training pipelines.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered persistent `NaN` values that were not immediately obvious, requiring additional preprocessing steps.
  - Debugging input shape errors took more time than anticipated due to the complex nature of the model's architecture.

- **Future Application:** 
  - Moving forward, data validation steps will be incorporated earlier in the pipeline to catch issues before they impact model training.
  - Will apply similar logging and error handling strategies across other models and processes to maintain consistency.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete LSTM Model Training:** Finalize the LSTM model training with the corrected data preprocessing steps and ensure no `NaN` values are present.
- **ARIMA Model Debugging:** Continue debugging the ARIMA model, particularly focusing on handling time series data correctly.
- **Enhance Error Logging:** Improve error logging in other parts of the project to ensure comprehensive monitoring during training sessions.
- **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for data preprocessing functions to catch issues like `NaN` values before they propagate into model training.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Data Preprocessing for LSTM

```python
# Handling NaN values and reshaping input for LSTM model
if np.isnan(X_train_reshaped).any() or np.isnan(X_val_reshaped).any() or np.isnan(y_train).any() or np.isnan(y_val).any():
    self.logger.log(level=logging.WARNING, msg="NaN values detected in the input data. Filling NaNs with column means.")
    X_train_reshaped = np.nan_to_num(X_train_reshaped, nan=np.nanmean(X_train_reshaped))
    X_val_reshaped = np.nan_to_num(X_val_reshaped, nan=np.nanmean(X_val_reshaped))
    y_train = np.nan_to_num(y_train, nan=np.nanmean(y_train))
    y_val = np.nan_to_num(y_val, nan=np.nanmean(y_val))

# Reshaping data to match LSTM input requirements
X_train_reshaped = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], -1))
X_val_reshaped = X_val.reshape((X_val.shape[0], X_val.shape[1], -1))
```

### Logging Adjustments

```python
# Corrected logging syntax
self.logger.log(level=logging.INFO, msg="Starting LSTM model training...")
```
