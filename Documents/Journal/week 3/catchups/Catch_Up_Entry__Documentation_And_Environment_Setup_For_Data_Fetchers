# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Documentation_And_Environment_Setup_For_Data_Fetchers**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The main objective was to enhance the documentation and improve the environment setup for the data fetcher scripts in the Trading Robot project. The focus was on adding detailed docstrings and relevant comments to `real_time_fetcher.py` and `API_interaction.py`, ensuring proper error handling, and resolving environment setup issues.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Added comprehensive docstrings and comments to `real_time_fetcher.py` and `API_interaction.py` to improve code readability and maintainability. This included explanations for classes, methods, and functions, detailing their purpose, arguments, and return values.
  - Enhanced error handling in both scripts to ensure that exceptions are properly logged and managed.
  - Resolved a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `dotenv` module by guiding the installation of `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables effectively.
  - Staged the updated scripts in Git, committed the changes with a clear message that acknowledged Aria's contribution, and pushed the changes to the remote repository.
  
- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - The primary challenge was addressing the `ModuleNotFoundError` related to the `dotenv` module. This was resolved by ensuring the correct installation of the required package.
  - Another challenge was ensuring that the updated documentation was consistent and thorough, which was achieved through meticulous attention to detail during the editing process.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The updated documentation and error handling have significantly improved the quality and maintainability of the `real_time_fetcher.py` and `API_interaction.py` scripts. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and work with these scripts in the future.
  - Resolving the environment setup issue ensures that the project can run smoothly across different environments, reducing the likelihood of future errors related to missing dependencies.

```python
# Function to fetch real-time data from Alpha Vantage API
def construct_alpha_api_url(self, symbol: str) -> str:
    return (
        f"{self.ALPHA_BASE_URL}?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY"
        f"&symbol={symbol}&interval=1min&apikey={self.alpha_api_key}"
    )

# Function to fetch real-time data for a given ticker symbol
def fetch_real_time_data(self, symbol: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    try:
        url = self.construct_alpha_api_url(symbol)
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        results = self.extract_alpha_results(data)
    except (requests.exceptions.HTTPError, ValueError, RuntimeError) as e:
        url = self.construct_polygon_api_url(symbol)
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        results = self.extract_polygon_results(data)

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
    df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)
    df['symbol'] = symbol
    return df
```

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting, enhancing documentation, and improving error handling in the data fetcher scripts.
- **Version Control (Git):** Used for staging, committing, and pushing changes to the remote repository, with a clear and descriptive commit message.
- **Environment Management:** Managed environment variables using `python-dotenv`, ensuring that sensitive information such as API keys is handled securely.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to catch and log exceptions, improving the reliability and debuggability of the scripts.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - The importance of detailed documentation was reinforced, as it greatly aids in the readability and maintainability of the code. 
  - Proper error handling is crucial for building reliable scripts that can gracefully manage unexpected issues.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - The `ModuleNotFoundError` was an unexpected challenge, but it highlighted the importance of ensuring all dependencies are properly installed and managed in the environment.
  
- **Future Application:** 
  - Moving forward, similar attention to detail will be applied to other scripts in the project to ensure consistency in documentation and error handling across the codebase. 
  - Regular checks will be implemented to ensure all necessary packages are installed, especially when working in different environments or sharing the project with others.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete Documentation Review:** Continue reviewing and updating documentation for other modules in the project to maintain consistency.
- **Refactor Additional Scripts:** Apply similar improvements to other data fetcher scripts to enhance readability and error handling.
- **Test the Changes:** Conduct thorough testing of the updated scripts to ensure that they function correctly with the improved error handling and documentation.
- **Optimize Data Fetching:** Explore potential optimizations for data fetching to improve performance and reduce API call frequency.
- **Implement Caching Mechanism:** Start working on a caching mechanism to reduce redundant API requests and enhance efficiency.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Constructing API URLs in `RealTimeDataFetcher`

```python
def construct_alpha_api_url(self, symbol: str) -> str:
    """
    Constructs the API URL for fetching data from Alpha Vantage.

    Args:
        symbol (str): The stock symbol to fetch data for.

    Returns:
        str: The constructed API URL.
    """
    return (
        f"{self.ALPHA_BASE_URL}?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY"
        f"&symbol={symbol}&interval=1min&apikey={self.alpha_api_key}"
    )
```

### Fetching Real-Time Data with Error Handling

```python
def fetch_real_time_data(self, symbol: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Fetches real-time data for a given ticker symbol.

    Args:
        symbol (str): The stock symbol to fetch data for.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The fetched real-time data as a pandas DataFrame.
    
    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If both Alpha Vantage and Polygon API requests fail.
    """
    try:
        # Try fetching data from Alpha Vantage
        url = self.construct_alpha_api_url(symbol)
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        logger.info("Alpha Vantage API response data: %s", data)

        # Check for rate limit message
        if 'Information' in data and 'rate limit' in data['Information'].lower():
            raise RuntimeError("Alpha Vantage API rate limit has been reached. Switching to Polygon.")

        results = self.extract_alpha_results(data)
    except (requests.exceptions.HTTPError, ValueError, RuntimeError) as e:
        logger.warning("Alpha Vantage fetch failed: %s", e)
        # Fallback to Polygon API
        try:
            url = self.construct_polygon_api_url(symbol)
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
            logger.info("Polygon API response data: %s", data)

            results = self.extract_polygon_results(data)
        except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
            logger.error("Polygon API request failed: %s", e)
            if response.status_code == 403:
                raise RuntimeError("Polygon API access forbidden: Check your API key and permissions.")
            else:
                raise RuntimeError(f"Polygon API request failed: {e}")

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
    df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)
    df['symbol'] = symbol
    return df
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Improvement Idea:** Consider implementing a more robust fallback mechanism for API calls, perhaps with additional APIs or a local cache to handle scenarios where both Alpha Vantage and Polygon APIs are unavailable.
- **Reflection:** The project is on track, and the recent improvements in documentation and error handling will greatly benefit future development. However, regular code reviews and peer feedback could further enhance code quality.
- **Feedback:** Positive feedback was received regarding the updated documentation and the clear commit message that credited Aria's contributions.
