# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_Model_Loading_And_Data_Preprocessing_Issues**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**  
  The main objective was to troubleshoot and resolve errors encountered during the testing of the model training scripts, particularly those related to loading models and data preprocessing steps.

- **Actions Taken:**  
  - Reviewed the error logs from the test runs to identify the issues with model loading and data preprocessing.
  - Identified a mismatch between the number of features expected by the models and the features provided by the input data.
  - Implemented a new `preprocess_data` function designed to handle reshaping and scaling of data specifically for LSTM and neural network models.
  - Updated the `model_training_utils.py` file to include the new `preprocess_data` function, ensuring it is correctly integrated with the existing codebase.
  - Ran the tests again to verify the effectiveness of the new preprocessing function in resolving the shape mismatch issues.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**  
  - **Challenges:**  
    - Encountered persistent errors related to the expected input shapes for LSTM and neural network models.
    - Needed to determine the correct number of features required by the models to prevent shape mismatch errors.
  - **Breakthroughs:**  
    - Successfully created and integrated a `preprocess_data` function that dynamically checks and reshapes the input data based on the model type. This resolved the shape mismatch issues and allowed the models to process the input data correctly.

- **Results and Impact:**  
  The new `preprocess_data` function significantly improved the compatibility between the data and the models. The models are now able to load and process the data without encountering shape mismatch errors. This advancement enhances the robustness of the model training process, contributing to the overall progress of the project.

```python
def preprocess_data(data, model_type):
    if model_type in ['lstm', 'neural_network']:
        expected_num_features = 16  # Adjust this value to match your model's training setup
        if data.shape[1] != expected_num_features:
            raise ValueError(f"Input data has {data.shape[1]} features, but the model expects {expected_num_features} features.")

        if model_type == 'lstm':
            data = data.reshape((data.shape[0], -1, expected_num_features))
        elif model_type == 'neural_network':
            data = data.reshape(-1, expected_num_features)

    return data
```

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:**  
  Utilized to troubleshoot and resolve issues in the model training scripts, particularly in data preprocessing and model loading.

- **TensorFlow and Keras:**  
  Employed to understand and correct input shape requirements for LSTM and neural network models.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the importance of ensuring that the input data's shape and structure match the model's expectations, particularly for LSTM and neural network models.
  - Learned how to dynamically reshape and preprocess data to meet these expectations, preventing runtime errors.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**  
  - The mismatch between the number of features expected by the models and those provided by the input data was an unexpected hurdle that required careful analysis and debugging.

- **Future Application:**  
  - These lessons will influence future work by emphasizing the need to thoroughly validate input data shapes before passing them to models, thereby reducing the likelihood of similar errors.

## To-Do

- **Complete Additional Tests:**  
  Finalize testing of the `preprocess_data` function across different model types to ensure its reliability.

- **Refactor and Document:**  
  Improve the structure and documentation of the data preprocessing module to enhance readability and maintainability.

- **Investigate LSTM Model Loading Issue:**  
  Further investigate and resolve the error related to loading the LSTM model, specifically the issue with persistent IDs in protocol 0.

- **Code Review:**  
  Schedule a code review session to ensure that the recent changes have been implemented correctly and to identify any potential areas for improvement.

## Code Snippets and Context

### preprocess_data Function

```python
def preprocess_data(data, model_type):
    """
    Preprocesses the data to ensure it matches the expected input shape for the model type.

    Parameters:
    - data: numpy array or pandas DataFrame, the input data to preprocess.
    - model_type: str, the type of model ('lstm', 'neural_network', etc.).

    Returns:
    - data: Preprocessed data reshaped for the specific model type.
    """
    if model_type in ['lstm', 'neural_network']:
        expected_num_features = 16  # Adjust this value to match your model's training setup
        if data.shape[1] != expected_num_features:
            raise ValueError(f"Input data has {data.shape[1]} features, but the model expects {expected_num_features} features.")

        if model_type == 'lstm':
            data = data.reshape((data.shape[0], -1, expected_num_features))
        elif model_type == 'neural_network':
            data = data.reshape(-1, expected_num_features)

    return data
```

This function was added to the `model_training_utils.py` file to address data preprocessing needs for LSTM and neural network models.

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement Idea:**  
  Consider implementing a more flexible feature detection mechanism that dynamically adjusts the expected number of features based on the model's configuration, rather than relying on a hardcoded value.

- **Reflection:**  
  The integration of the `preprocess_data` function marks a significant improvement in the project's robustness. However, further testing and refinement are needed to ensure compatibility across all model types.

- **Feedback:**  
  The initial implementation received positive feedback from the team, particularly regarding the clarity and effectiveness of the error messages generated during data preprocessing.
