# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Random_Forest_Model_Tuning_and_Performance_Evaluation**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  The main goal for this work session was to optimize the Random Forest model by tuning hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance metrics.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Conducted a hyperparameter tuning process, testing various combinations of parameters including `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`.
  - Evaluated the performance of each trial using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R²).
  - Identified the best-performing model configuration and logged the results, including the best hyperparameters and feature importances.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - A significant breakthrough was identifying the optimal set of hyperparameters that minimized the validation MSE to 49.55. This required extensive trial and error but ultimately resulted in a model with excellent predictive accuracy (R² = 1.00).
  - A challenge encountered was dealing with deprecated features in the libraries used, which required attention to ensure future compatibility of the code.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The tuning process successfully identified a Random Forest model configuration that provided superior performance metrics, with a validation RMSE of 7.04 and MAE of 3.63.
  - These results will serve as a baseline for future model training sessions, ensuring that subsequent models can be compared and potentially improved upon using this configuration.

**Example:**

```python
# Best model parameters identified:
best_params = {'n_estimators': 133, 'max_depth': 40, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1}

# Example code for initializing the RandomForestRegressor with these parameters:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=best_params['n_estimators'],
    max_depth=best_params['max_depth'],
    min_samples_split=best_params['min_samples_split'],
    min_samples_leaf=best_params['min_samples_leaf'],
    random_state=42
)
```

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized to systematically explore and optimize the parameters of the Random Forest model, leading to improved predictive performance.
- **Python Programming:** Applied for scripting the model training and tuning processes, leveraging libraries like Scikit-learn for machine learning and Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted performance evaluation using various error metrics to assess the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Logging and Debugging:** Employed to track the progress of model training and to troubleshoot deprecated features in the libraries used.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Improved understanding of hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest models and the impact of each parameter on model performance.
  - Recognized the importance of staying updated with library versions to avoid deprecated features and maintain code compatibility.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered a deprecation warning regarding the use of the `'squared'` option in error calculation, highlighting the need to review and update the codebase for compatibility with future library versions.

- **Future Application:** 
  - The insights gained from this tuning process will be directly applicable to optimizing other models in the project, ensuring that the best possible performance is achieved across different algorithms.
  - Future tuning sessions will be approached with a focus on monitoring for deprecated features and updating the code accordingly.

## To-Do

- **Code Refactoring:** Update the codebase to remove deprecated features and ensure compatibility with future versions of the libraries used.
- **Documentation:** Document the identified best hyperparameters and feature importances for future reference in model training sessions.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of the tuned Random Forest model with other algorithms to identify the best approach for the specific use case.
- **Feature Analysis:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the feature importances to understand which features contribute most significantly to the model's predictions.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Model Initialization with Best Parameters

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\ModelTraining\model_training\models\random_forest.py

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize the RandomForestRegressor with optimized hyperparameters
model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=133,
    max_depth=40,
    min_samples_split=2,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    random_state=42
)

# Fit the model to the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set
validation_predictions = model.predict(X_validation)
```

### Feature Importances Logging

```python
# Logging the feature importances identified by the model
import numpy as np

feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
sorted_indices = np.argsort(feature_importances)[::-1]

for index in sorted_indices:
    print(f"Feature {index}: Importance {feature_importances[index]}")
```
