  - Corrected data input shapes and ensured the GRU and LSTM layers received the correct 3D input.
  - Debugged the neural network script to handle 'type' references within the model configuration, ensuring that layers were correctly instantiated.
  - Refined the script to process data with any combination of columns as selected by the user.
  
- **Random Forest Model:**
  - Implemented and fine-tuned a Random Forest model using Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Utilized time series cross-validation to evaluate the model performance across different time splits.
  - Logged the best hyperparameters and model performance metrics to track improvements.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenges:**
  - Encountered issues with data shape incompatibility for GRU layers in the neural network.
  - Faced a KeyError due to incorrect handling of layer parameters during the model-building process.
  - Addressed the challenge of finding the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model while ensuring the script ran efficiently.

- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Successfully resolved the GRU layer input shape issues, allowing the neural network model to train without errors.
  - Optimized the Random Forest model, achieving a validation MSE of 7199.95 and an R² of 0.94, indicating strong model performance.

### Results and Impact
- **Neural Network Model:**
  - The model now correctly handles user-defined column combinations and successfully trains with the appropriate data shapes.
  - The improvements in handling layer instantiation and parameter passing ensure that the model is flexible and robust for different configurations.

- **Random Forest Model:**
  - The optimized Random Forest model achieved significant performance metrics, and the best parameters identified by Optuna provide a solid foundation for future training sessions.
  - The detailed logging of feature importances and model metrics helps guide further model refinement and interpretation.

```python
# Correcting GRU layer instantiation in neural network model
self.model.add(GRU(units=layer['units'], activation=layer['activation'], return_sequences=layer.get('return_sequences', False)))
```

```python
# Example from Random Forest model training with Optuna optimization
study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize', sampler=TPESampler(seed=random_state))
study.optimize(lambda trial: cached_objective(trial, X_train, y_train, cv_folds), n_trials=n_trials)
```
