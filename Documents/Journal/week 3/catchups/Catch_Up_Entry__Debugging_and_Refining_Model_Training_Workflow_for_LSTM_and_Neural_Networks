**Catch_Up_Entry__Debugging_and_Refining_Model_Training_Workflow_for_LSTM_and_Neural_Networks**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** The primary objective was to resolve the issues encountered during the model training phase, specifically addressing the errors in LSTM and Neural Network configurations.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - **LSTM Model Refinement:** Debugged and modified the LSTM model configuration to fix the `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` error. Adjusted the parameter handling to ensure correct access and utilization within the model architecture.
  - **Neural Network Configuration:** Ensured that the Neural Network trainer is configured properly with correct logging and callback setup. Adjusted the TensorFlow strategy and fixed issues related to incorrect epoch usage.
  - **Testing and Execution:** Re-ran the model training script multiple times to validate the corrections and confirm that the models were functioning as intended without errors.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** The primary challenge was identifying the root cause of the `'Functional' object is not subscriptable` error. The error was subtle and related to how parameters were being accessed and used within the model configuration.
  - **Breakthrough:** The breakthrough came from a detailed inspection of how the LSTM model was being initialized and how parameters were passed. Adjusting the model definition resolved the issue, allowing the training process to proceed without errors.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The corrections led to a successful execution of both LSTM and Neural Network training processes. These adjustments improved the robustness of the model training workflow and ensured that the project could progress to more complex model evaluations and tuning.

```python
class LSTMModelConfig:
    @staticmethod
    def lstm_model(input_shape, params):
        inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
        x = inputs
        
        for layer in params['layers']:
            if layer['type'] == 'lstm':
                x = LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer.get('return_sequences', False), kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None))(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'bidirectional_lstm':
                x = Bidirectional(LSTM(units=layer['units'], return_sequences=layer.get('return_sequences', False), kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None)))(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'batch_norm':
                x = BatchNormalization()(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'dropout':
                x = Dropout(rate=layer['rate'])(x)
            elif layer['type'] == 'attention':
                x = Attention()([x, x])
            elif layer['type'] == 'dense':
                x = Dense(units=layer['units'], activation=layer['activation'], kernel_regularizer=layer.get('kernel_regularizer', None))(x)

        outputs = Dense(1)(x)
        model = Model(inputs, outputs)
        model.compile(optimizer=params['optimizer'], loss=params['loss'])
        
        return model
```
