# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Import_Errors_and_KeyErrors_in_Advanced_LSTM_Model_Trainer**

---

## Work Completed
### Objectives and Goals:
- The primary goal was to debug and resolve import errors in the `advanced_lstm_trainer.py` script and to address a `KeyError` that occurred during sequence creation in the LSTM model training process.

### Actions Taken:
- **Import Error Resolution:** 
  - Adjusted the script to ensure the correct paths were added to `sys.path` for importing necessary modules, such as `LoggerHandler` and `ConfigManager`.
  - Verified the directory structure and corrected the import paths, especially for the `config_handling` module located in `Scripts.Utilities`.
- **KeyError Debugging:**
  - Investigated the cause of the `KeyError` by reviewing the `create_sequences` function. 
  - Added validation checks to ensure sufficient data length before attempting to create sequences. 
  - Enhanced the function to catch and log errors related to index out-of-bounds situations.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs:
- **Challenges:**
  - The main challenge was ensuring the correct modules were imported given the project’s complex directory structure.
  - Encountered a `KeyError` during sequence creation, which required careful debugging to identify the root cause.
- **Breakthroughs:**
  - Successfully resolved the import issues by correctly setting the project root and adding the necessary directories to `sys.path`.
  - Implemented a more robust `create_sequences` function that prevents sequence creation when there isn’t enough data, reducing the likelihood of future errors.

### Results and Impact:
- The script now runs without import errors, ensuring that all necessary modules are correctly loaded.
- The improvements to the `create_sequences` function have increased the reliability of the LSTM model training process by preventing `KeyError` incidents. This will streamline the training process and reduce downtime caused by such errors.

```python
# Example of adjusted import and sequence creation function

import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Adjust import path based on project structure
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parents[3]
utilities_dir = project_root / 'Scripts' / 'Utilities'
sys.path.append(str(utilities_dir))

# Enhanced create_sequences function with validation
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    if len(data) <= time_steps:
        raise ValueError(f"Not enough data to create sequences with time_steps={time_steps}. Data length: {len(data)}")
    
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        try:
            x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
            y = target[i + time_steps]
            xs.append(x)
            ys.append(y)
        except KeyError as e:
            logger.error(f"KeyError encountered at index {i + time_steps}: {e}")
            raise
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

## Code Snippets and Context
### Enhanced Sequence Creation Function

```python
def create_sequences(data, target, time_steps=10):
    xs, ys = [], []
    if len(data) <= time_steps:
        raise ValueError(f"Not enough data to create sequences with time_steps={time_steps}. Data length: {len(data)}")
    
    for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
        try:
            x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
            y = target[i + time_steps]
            xs.append(x)
            ys.append(y)
        except KeyError as e:
            logger.error(f"KeyError encountered at index {i + time_steps}: {e}")
            raise
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Brainstorming:** Consider adding automated checks for data sufficiency before any sequence processing begins. This could be implemented as a utility function across different model training scripts.
- **Improvements:** Further refine the error messages and logging details to make them more informative for debugging purposes.
- **Reflection:** The focus on error handling and import management has significantly improved the stability of the LSTM model training process, setting a strong foundation for future model development and training.
