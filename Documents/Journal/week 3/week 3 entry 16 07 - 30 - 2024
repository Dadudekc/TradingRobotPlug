## Work Completed

### Objectives and Goals
- Implement and enhance the LSTM model training script with proper logging and attention mechanism integration.
- Address issues related to module imports and code organization for better maintainability.
- Successfully execute and debug the LSTM model training process, including handling data preprocessing, model configuration, and evaluation.

### Actions Taken
- **Organized Codebase:** Moved files into a more structured directory layout to enhance maintainability and avoid import errors.
- **Logging Implementation:** Enhanced logging throughout the scripts to track the flow of execution and capture key data points during model training and evaluation.
- **Attention Layer Integration:** Integrated a custom attention mechanism into the LSTM model and ensured proper functionality by creating a dedicated module for it.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Conducted a full cycle of training, validation, and evaluation of the LSTM model on the provided dataset, monitoring performance metrics and adjusting configurations as necessary.

### Challenges and Breakthroughs
- **Challenge:** Encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to incorrect module import paths after restructuring the directory.
  - **Breakthrough:** Resolved the issue by correctly adjusting the Python path and verifying that all modules were properly imported according to the new directory structure.
- **Challenge:** Initial model training resulted in high loss values and poor performance metrics.
  - **Breakthrough:** Implemented early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques to stabilize the training process and improve model performance.

### Results and Impact
- The restructuring of the project and implementation of comprehensive logging greatly improved code maintainability and debugging efficiency.
- Successfully trained an LSTM model with an attention mechanism, although the model's performance indicated the need for further hyperparameter tuning and potential adjustments in data preprocessing.
- The detailed logs provided valuable insights into the model’s training process, highlighting areas that need improvement.

```python
# Example code snippet for model evaluation
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, validation_data=(X_val_scaled, y_val), epochs=epochs, batch_size=32,
          callbacks=[early_stopping, reduce_lr, checkpoint, lr_scheduler])
y_pred_val = model.predict(X_val_scaled).flatten()
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred_val)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
r2 = r2_score(y_val, y_pred_val)
self.logger.info(f"Validation MSE: {mse:.2f}, RMSE: {rmse:.2f}, R²: {r2:.2f}")
```
