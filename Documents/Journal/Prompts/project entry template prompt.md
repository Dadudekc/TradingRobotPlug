```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\Data_Fetch\alpha_vantage_df
# Scripts\Data_Fetch\alpha_vantage_df

import os
import sys

# Add project root to the Python path
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir))
sys.path.append(project_root)

# Function to fetch data from Alpha Vantage API
def fetch_data(api_key, symbol):
    # Detailed implementation here
    pass
```

### Unit Test for Data Fetch Script

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Tests\Data_Fetch\test_alpha_vantage_df.py
# Tests\Data_Fetch\test_alpha_vantage_df.py
# To Run:

# 2nd: python -m unittest Data_Fetch.test_alpha_vantage_df

import unittest

class TestAlphaVantageDF(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fetch_data(self):
        # Test implementation here
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
