Hi ChatGPT,

I have several Python scripts in a project, and I need to standardize the way paths and logging are handled across all files. The project root is `C:\TheTradingRobotPlug`.

**Here’s what I need:**
1. **Dynamic Root Path**: Automatically determine and set the project root based on the script’s location.
2. **Resource and Log Directory Setup**: Define and create directories for resources and logs if they do not already exist.
3. **Logging Configuration**: Set up logging to output to 'application.log' within the 'logs' directory.
4. **Conditional Imports**: Implement conditional imports based on whether the script is in a testing or production environment.

**Required Script Template:**

# File: <File Name>
# Location: <Relative Path from Project Root>
# Description: <Brief Description of Script Functionality>

import os
import sys
import logging

# Determine the script's directory
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Determine the project root dynamically
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir))

# Add project root to the Python path
sys.path.append(project_root)

# Set up relative paths for resources and logs
resources_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'resources')
log_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'logs')

# Ensure the directories exist
os.makedirs(resources_path, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(log_path, exist_ok=True)

# Logging configuration
log_file = os.path.join(log_path, 'application.log')
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=log_file,
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Conditional imports based on execution context
try:
    from some_production_module import ProductionClass
except ImportError:
    from unittest.mock import Mock as ProductionClass

next i will post my files for you to standardize  and improve as far as efficiency
