Title: Integration and Enhancement of Data Fetching Functionality

Summary:
Today, we focused on integrating and enhancing the data fetching functionality for our trading robot application. This involved merging and refining the data fetcher modules for Alpha Vantage and Polygon.io, ensuring consistency and reliability in data operations. Key improvements included ensuring correct data conversion to pandas DataFrames, adding metadata collection, and implementing detailed logging for better traceability.

Details:

Refinement of Alpha Vantage Data Fetcher:

Merged the two existing versions of alpha_vantage_fetcher.py.
Ensured correct data extraction and conversion to pandas DataFrames.
Implemented asynchronous data fetching for both historical and real-time data.
Added metadata collection during the data fetching process.
Ensured detailed logging for each step in the data fetching process.
Verified and validated data before saving.
Refinement of Polygon.io Data Fetcher:

Merged the two existing versions of polygon_fetcher.py.
Ensured correct data extraction and conversion to pandas DataFrames.
Implemented asynchronous data fetching for both historical and real-time data.
Added metadata collection during the data fetching process.
Ensured detailed logging for each step in the data fetching process.
Verified and validated data before saving.
Enhancement of Data Store Module:

Combined functionalities from different versions of the data_store.py to support various data operations.
Implemented saving and loading data to/from CSV and SQL databases.
Added comprehensive logging to the data store operations for better traceability.
Implemented metadata collection to store source URLs, timestamps of data fetches, response statuses, data sizes, fetching parameters, and storage locations.
Incorporated data lake storage for raw and processed data, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
User Interface Enhancements:

Updated the GUI to include a data fetch tab with functionalities to fetch data for specific symbols and date ranges.
Implemented real-time input validation and formatting for date fields.
Added functionality to display fetched data on an interactive candlestick chart using Plotly.
Integrated the Azure theme for a modern and consistent look and feel across the application.
