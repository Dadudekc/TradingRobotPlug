### Project Journal Entry
**Date: July 20, 2024**

#### Work Completed

**1. Data Preprocessing and Initial Setup**
   - Loaded the dataset `tsla_data.csv` from Alpha Vantage.
   - Inspected the initial data preview and ensured the 'index' column was present, creating one if necessary.
   - Dropped columns with more than 20% NaN values.
   - Converted the 'date' column to datetime format and filled remaining NaNs for numeric columns.
   - Applied label encoding to non-numeric columns except for the target column.

**2. Feature Engineering**
   - Implemented automated feature engineering using the `FeatureEngineering` class.
   - Ensured unnecessary parameters (like `max_depth`) were not passed to the `automated_feature_engineering` method.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.

**3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Defined a `RandomForestRegressor` model and parameter grid.
   - Utilized Optuna for hyperparameter tuning with TPESampler.
   - Created an objective function to minimize the negative R^2 score.
   - Performed optimization over 100 trials.

**4. Model Training and Validation**
   - Trained the best model found from hyperparameter tuning on the training set.
   - Validated the model on a separate test set.
   - Evaluated model performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R^2 score.

**5. Marketing Efforts**
   - Brainstormed the freemium model:
     - Basic Plan: Ends with model predictions.
     - Premium Plan: Includes full model deployment.
     - Enterprise Plan: Features a custom reinforcement learning algorithm that users can train or start with a provided one.

**6. Workstation and Version Control**
   - Confirmed Git is added to the system PATH and recognized by PowerShell.
   - Verified Git installation by running `git --version`.
   - Cloned the repository:
     ```sh
     cd /path/to/your/desired/directory
     git clone https://github.com/dadudekc/TradingRobotPlug.git
     ```

**7. Setting Up New Work Laptop**
   - Generated a comprehensive list of installed packages using `pip freeze`.
   - Created and updated `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility across different environments.
   - Resolved issues related to specific package versions by modifying `requirements.txt`.
   - Explored the possibility of using Synergy software to share a single keyboard and mouse across multiple laptops.
   - Initiated steps to download and install Synergy on both laptops.
   - Planned the configuration of one laptop as the server and the other as the client.

**8. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging for Trading Environment**
   - Added detailed error handling and logging to the `TradingEnv` class.
   - Configured logging to capture key events and exceptions.
   - Improved methods for resetting the environment, executing steps, taking actions, and calculating rewards.

**9. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging for Model Trainer**
   - Added logging statements to capture the preprocessing of data, environment creation, and model training processes.
   - Included try-except blocks in critical methods to catch and log exceptions.
   - Ensured the `DRLModelTrainer` class logs detailed error messages for better issue diagnosis.

**10. Improved MLRobotUtils Logging Utility**
   - Added error handling to the logging initialization in the `MLRobotUtils` class.
   - Included type checking for the log text widget to ensure it is a Tkinter `Text` widget.
   - Provided detailed error messages for logging operations.

**11. Resolved Module Import Issue**
   - Diagnosed and provided steps to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `stable_baselines3` package.
   - Guided on how to install the required package using `pip`.

**12. Best Model Parameters**
   ```plaintext
   Best trial: 9
   Best value: 0.9998215387729971
   Best parameters: {'n_estimators': 100, 'max_depth': 10}

   ```

**13. Resolved Module Import Issue**
   - Diagnosed and provided steps to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `Scripts.ModelTraining` package.
   - Adjusted the script to dynamically set the Python path using `os` and `sys` modules.
   - Verified the script structure and corrected the import paths to ensure smooth execution.
