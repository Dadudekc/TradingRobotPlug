#### **Lessons Learned:**

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Importance of systematically optimizing hyperparameters to improve model performance.
   - Utilization of tools like Optuna can automate and streamline the hyperparameter tuning process.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Exploring different architectures, such as adding more layers, using GRU layers, or Bidirectional LSTM, can potentially lead to performance improvements.
   - Keeping the architecture flexible allows for iterative experimentation and fine-tuning.

3. **Learning Rate Scheduling:**
   - Dynamic adjustment of the learning rate during training can help achieve better convergence and prevent overfitting.
   - Implementing schedulers like `ReduceLROnPlateau` can automatically adjust the learning rate based on validation performance.

4. **Git Workflow:**
   - Need to regularly pull changes from the remote repository to avoid conflicts.
   - Understanding the merge process and resolving conflicts are essential for maintaining a clean and synchronized codebase.

5. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensuring all input features are numerical is crucial for TensorFlow compatibility.
   - Properly handling `Timestamp` objects and other non-numerical data types is necessary for seamless model training.

6. **Model Checkpointing:**
   - The importance of using the correct file extensions for model checkpointing in TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Adapting to new changes in libraries and frameworks ensures smooth functionality.

#### **To-Do List:**

1. **Refine Hyperparameters:**
   - Integrate Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.
   - Define the search space for key hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of LSTM units, batch size, number of layers).
   - Run Optuna to find the optimal hyperparameters.

2. **Experiment with Model Architectures:**
   - Modify the current model architecture to include different configurations (e.g., additional LSTM layers, GRU layers, Bidirectional LSTM).
   - Evaluate the performance of each modified architecture to identify the best-performing model.

3. **Implement Learning Rate Scheduling:**
   - Choose a suitable learning rate scheduler (e.g., `ReduceLROnPlateau`).
   - Integrate the scheduler into the training process and monitor its impact on model performance.

4. **Monitor and Iterate:**
   - Continuously monitor the performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) during training and validation.
   - Make necessary adjustments based on the results and iterate on the model architecture and hyperparameters.

5. **Update the Repository:**
   - Ensure that all recent changes are committed and pushed to the remote repository.
   - Regularly check for any updates from the remote repository to avoid conflicts.
