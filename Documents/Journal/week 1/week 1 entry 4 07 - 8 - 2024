Project Journal Entry
Date: July 8, 2024

Context:
Today is the day after a major hurricane hit the area. There's no power anywhere, but despite these challenging conditions, I'm still making progress on the project. It's been a difficult day, but I've managed to find ways to get things done.

Accomplishments:
1. Implemented Asynchronous Data Fetching and Real-Time Data Support:

Refactored the DataFetcher Base Class:

Added support for asynchronous data fetching using aiohttp.
Introduced methods for asynchronously fetching historical data (fetch_data) and real-time data (fetch_real_time_data).
Added functionality for saving data with options for versioning and archiving.
Implemented data validation before saving to ensure data integrity.
AlphaVantageDataFetcher:

Constructed API URLs for historical data.
Implemented result extraction from API responses.
Developed asynchronous methods for fetching real-time data.
Extracted real-time results from API responses.
NasdaqDataFetcher:

Constructed API URLs for historical data.
Implemented result extraction from API responses.
Added specific handling for 404 errors.
Developed asynchronous methods for fetching real-time data.
Extracted real-time results from API responses.
PolygonDataFetcher:

Constructed API URLs for historical data.
Implemented result extraction from API responses.
Developed asynchronous methods for fetching real-time data.
Extracted real-time results from API responses.
2. Updated Main Script:

Refactored to use the new asynchronous methods for data fetching.
Included validation and saving of data after fetching.
Added appropriate messages based on the fetch results.
3. Enhanced Logging:

Improved logging throughout the fetchers for better debugging and monitoring.
Reflections:
Despite the lack of power and the challenges posed by the aftermath of the hurricane, it's been a productive day. The refactor to include asynchronous data fetching and real-time support is a significant improvement to the system, making it more efficient and robust. This update will greatly enhance the trading robot's performance and reliability. Persevering through difficult circumstances has proven that progress can be made even in tough times.
