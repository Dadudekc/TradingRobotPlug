Project Resume: Trading Robot Development
Project Overview:
The Trading Robot project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at developing an automated trading system. The system is designed to fetch and process financial data, apply trading strategies, and execute trades. The project incorporates various technologies and methodologies to ensure robustness, modularity, and scalability.

Key Skills and Technologies:
1. Python Programming:

Modules and Packages:
Developed and organized Python scripts into modular packages for better maintainability and reusability.
Utilized __init__.py files to define packages and ensure proper module resolution.
Dynamic Path Management:
Implemented dynamic path addition to Python's sys.path to ensure portability across different environments.
2. Data Handling and Processing:

Data Fetching:
Developed scripts to fetch financial data from various APIs (Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io).
Used requests library for making HTTP requests and handling API responses.
Data Storage:
Created a DataStore class to handle data saving and retrieval from CSV files and SQL databases using pandas and sqlalchemy.
Implemented functions to save and fetch data from SQLite databases, ensuring data persistence.
3. Configuration Management:

Environment Variables:
Used dotenv to load environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
Configuration Files:
Switched to using a config.ini file for managing paths and other configurations.
Developed functions to load and handle configurations using configparser.
4. Error Handling and Logging:

Logging:
Set up logging mechanisms using Python’s logging module to capture and record errors and important events.
Created log files to maintain records of operations and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Error Handling:
Implemented robust error handling in data fetching and processing scripts to ensure the system's reliability and resilience.
5. Version Control:

Git:
Managed the project's source code using Git, ensuring proper version control and collaboration.
Resolved complex merge conflicts and maintained a clean commit history.
6. Testing and Validation:

Unit Testing:
Developed unit tests for various modules to ensure they work as expected using Python’s unittest framework.
Ensured test coverage for data fetching, processing, and storage functionalities.
Mocking:
Used unittest.mock to create mock objects for testing external dependencies and APIs.
7. Project Structure and Organization:

Directory Structure:
Organized project files and directories systematically for better readability and management.
Ensured separation of concerns by grouping related scripts and modules together.
Documentation:
Maintained a journal to document daily progress, key accomplishments, and next steps.
Project Directory Structure:
